A year ago I would have given it 5 stars but now I can't. The biggest difference is their chicken breasts. I bought 5 breasts last week to feed the family and there was virtually no meat on them. It's almost as if they cut the center out and there's only a little meat on both edges and a whole lot of breaded bone. It was ridiculous! Of course like an idiot I thought it was a fluke and bought another breast this week. Same thing. The other pieces are the usual size and quite tasty. I don't know what's going on but I would advise you not to buy the breasts even if you're a fan of white meat. They're the most expensive piece of chicken and not worth it at all. Otherwise the service is ok and when you call ahead it's ready for pickup about 75% of the time.","name":"Lucky Wishbone","address":"5220 S Nogales Hwy","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85706","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":22,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"WiFi":"u'no'","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","GoodForKids":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","Alcohol":"u'none'","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"False","BikeParking":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","HasTV":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","RestaurantsDelivery":"True"},"categories":"Food, Fast Food, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"vs2T4xh4PYtGy_NQLFmIYA","business_id":"gGCIGJcKWoPC9xZNDeX3pA","stars_x":4.0,"date":1314363535000,"text":"I  dream of a day they will open a venue in Colorado!

It's a Tucson chain that tries to compete in the sub sandwich category of fast food joints, but I'm pretty sure it's their frozen drinks keeping them afloat. The sandwiches are really bland & overpriced... & I don't know if they've changed this by now (it's been forever since I punished myself with an eegee's sub) but they charge extra for cheese & I didn't figure it out until I looked at my receipt. Booo! :(\n\nThat being said, if this was just a drink shop, I probably would've rated them four stars. Most of the flavors I tried were at least decent. There were some I thought tasted gross (Holly Berry comes to mind), some that were borderline gross but strangely addictive (oh God, Black Raspberry -- I hated you from the first sip, but how many of you did I buy over the course of the month?) & others that tasted like syrupy versions of what they were supposed to, but I just didn't care for (Tangerine, Strawberry, Mango). My absolute favorite is Watermelon, which is the July flavor. It reminds me simultaneously of a watermelon jolly rancher & the Friendly's Watermelon Slammer, both of which I love. & I won't lie, they're idiots for making it a Flavor of the Month, that liquid mouthsex should be available all year round, yo! (It kills me that I skipped town right before my favorite flavor came around again! Now I'm debating getting some shipped to Boston, to share with my friends here. haha)\n\nI've tried two or three of their cookie flavors, too. The pumpkin spice was great, & I can't remember the others I tried, but I don't think I've had a bad eegee's cookie. hehe. Besides, if you screw up cookies, which are probably baked from a premixed corporate tub of cookie dough to begin with, then that's pretty sad. :3\n\nAnyway, I wouldn't recommend their sandwiches... however, due to it being a local chain, I do believe every Tucsonan (& all curious out-of-towners) should try something from eegee's at least once. A small eegee will probably only set you back a buck & some change, so it's a small risk.

Everything is very heavily coated, so you are getting about 50% batter, 50% other stuff.\n\nWings: medium size, not very meaty, the coating (if any) was thin, but they were way over cooked and dry. The \"garlic parm\" sauce was strange. Some sort of fake butter and corn starch to thicken it. Not bad, but odd, and not good.\n\nChicken: over cooked, dry and just way too much coating.

They have a large plexiglass separating the cashier from patrons. The cashier was super nice. We had a lot of questions on the menu, and she was really great about explaining everything and giving her recommendations. \n\nThere are a LOT of choices. I ended up getting four tacos, because I wanted to try several things. I got a Taco Apson, Hass taco, barbacoa, and al pastor. The Hass and the pastor were my favorites, lots of flavor, but the pastor was pretty greasy. The barbacoa was just okay, and I thought I would like the Apson, but it was greasy and heavy. They do give you a really good portion of meat on your tacos. My husband got the Alambre, and he said the same; it was too heavy. Probably should have just stuck with carne asada tacos. They give you plenty of salsas and pico, but the avocado salsa had begun to brown. The red has some pretty good heat, so avoid it if you don't like spicy.\n\nWe did both over-order because we wanted to try a lot of things, but it wasn't very cheap.

Saw on the Tucson subreddit that this place was cited best Tucson tacos beating out various other places on a poll so decided to come here cause I trusted I would not be dissapointed just like the other taco place i had visited. Well....I was highly dissapointed.....if this is really the best tacos in TUS I feel sad for the people here and the people reviewing this place highly because these tacos are straight booty. About the crappiest taco I ever had in CA was better than the supposed \"best\" taco here. \n\nLets start of with the establishment first and the employees. Walked in and they do have a nice like mural collage thing on the right hand side that has pictures and info of the Apson band.Everything else looks pretty filthy. I wanted to walk out as soon as i stepped in there and it was only because the cashier girl said a loud Hello across the room that I continued in but....as soon as i got closer I realized she had an LA dodgers beanie on and she saw my baseball cap and thought it was from LA aswell but when she realized she made a mistake and it was actually the hat of a rival team her mood kinda changed from happy and giddy to slumping down on the counter and seeming disinterested and as I ordered I kept having to repeat myself cause it seemed like she wasnt paying attention. Anyway I placed my order then walked over to the salsa bar. On my way notice the bathroom area looked filthy the tables looked like decor was the last thing on their mind for the place,flies all over the inside and when I arrived at the salsa bar it looks like they dont have freshly made salsa for the day. I arrived only an hour after opening and 3 salsa were about empty and the rest of the salsa, cabbage,limes and other stuff look like they had been sitting out in the open for days.\n\nOn to the food, we decided to sit outside due to the inside looking filthy and the flies. Not the best of my ideas cause outside was fly infested as well and i dont know why i thought it would be different. Anyway we got our tacos. Wife ordered a taco apson and 2 pastor tacos. I ordered 2 tripa and 2 cabeza tacos. Id say the only good one was the taco apson which i believe is carne asada,hass chilies caramelized onions,mushrooms and cheese. I would come back for that single taco and only that taco. The pastor was horrendous, probably the worst in existence. Looks like they used the cheapest pork they could find and tinted it slightly red. Flavor was bland and it had so many fatty pieces in there that it was nasty and the salsa didnt help either. My tripas tacos were over fried. Almost crunchy like i was eating a bunch of kettle chips and the cabeza was bland but for some reason extremely wet. I bit into it and a puddle would accumulate on my plate with every bite and adding salsa to it only made the puddle turn into a freakin river on my plate. Ive never had a cabeza taco that was drenched like that.\n\nMy expectations for tacos are high but even with how bad they were I would have given the place a 2 based on the tacos but the actual establishment just looking filthy and uninspired, riddled with flies on the inside and out a zero star would have been more fitting but obviously cant go that low. \n\nLike I said, this place is booty but if you decide to go anyway. Get a Taco Apson and thats it. You stray from that path and youll get dissapointed. Being so close to the border you assume a Reddit vote from Tucson residents would be trustworthy but it sure as hell wasnt.","name":"Tacos Apson","address":"6741 N Thornydale Rd, Ste 121","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85741","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","HasTV":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"},"categories":"Tacos, Restaurants, Mexican"},{"review_id":"N1ocysd-bplUKl0TKMJpoQ","business_id":"Z75xSO_6mKuuPpRHE-GjHg","stars_x":5.0,"date":1632627338000,"text":"Didn't take any pics of our food this time because y'all know I've pretty much tried everything in this place and Loved it all so if you haven't tried this place your really missing out especially if your in this area, so come on...","name":"Tacos Apson","address":"6741 N Thornydale Rd, Ste 121","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85741","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","HasTV":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"},"categories":"Tacos, Restaurants, Mexican"},{"review_id":"0HEhrKMJDw11q23KfOrG9Q","business_id":"bc3K8KvLkLNu_XU3RkeeeA","stars_x":2.0,"date":1640718622000,"text":"The food is ok but the service is very slow....as in waiting over a half hour for a salad while 20 plus people in line after you are eating their lunch.\n\nStaff are snarky. \n\nThis is my third try and it's a strike out for me.","name":"LeBuzz Caffe","address":"2930 N Swan Rd, Ste 127","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85712","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":33,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"WiFi":"u'free'","OutdoorSeating":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True"},"categories":"Breakfast & Brunch, Restaurants, Salad, Sandwiches, Coffee & Tea, Food"},{"review_id":"MTkZNPlzLSTp7C6j-0iqEw","business_id":"Z75xSO_6mKuuPpRHE-GjHg","stars_x":1.0,"date":1642128264000,"text":"I love the one in central Tucson.

Coffee, espresso drinks, tea, pastries, breakfast and lunch; counter service only, with orders brought to your table.  This is the recently opened instance of the original popular Le Buzz on Tanque Verde.  I like Le Buzz on Tanque Verde.  I wasn't quite so enthusiastic about my visit here, although I would expect over time it will get better and closer to what I've come to expect from the original store.  \n\nA key feature of either location is the plethora of pastries.  These are very good.  The breakfast items can be quite good -- I tried something new and found it not to my liking, but I've otherwise always enjoyed the items I've ordered from this menu at the other location, and expect if I had ordered my usual, it would have been fine.\n\nDining room is spartan, but clean, and there appeared to be plenty of seating, with two rather lovely outdoor areas -- one outdoor area sitting in sunlight (great this time of year) and facing the parking lot, and one inside the courtyard, where one can hear the water from the fountain and you sit in cool shade and plants (better in spring and summer).\n\nService was well-meaning, but marginal, and judging from the very gentle yet obvious reprimand I saw one server give another, still a work in progress.  This too, I believe, will get better. \n\nMy primary complaint for this visit was the coffee -- tepid in temperature (one of my unforgivable coffee sins), and extraordinarily bitter, quite unlike what I get at the other location.  I assume it will get better.  Maybe it was just that morning.\n\nBottom line, for now: lovely outdoor spaces, wonderful pastries, and eventually good coffee.  If you like coffee shops, I think this will be worth a visit.","name":"LeBuzz Caffe","address":"2930 N Swan Rd, Ste 127","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85712","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":33,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"WiFi":"u'free'","OutdoorSeating":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True"},"categories":"Breakfast & Brunch, Restaurants, Salad, Sandwiches, Coffee & Tea, Food"},{"review_id":"0QAXhNTWCvCG1eNtu3JVNQ","business_id":"bc3K8KvLkLNu_XU3RkeeeA","stars_x":2.0,"date":1636328045000,"text":"Stopped in on high recommendations.

During the pandemic, this early morning breakfast spot just halfway on my dogwalk has been a bright spot of my morning.  I've been back now to LeBuzz -- well, my dog and I -- several times now.  I've wanted to write this review because it's one of the few places, if any, that I've thought, \"If I ever open a cafe, this is exactly how I would do it.\"  It's as if they've opened a restaurant just for me.  What do they do right?:\n-Friendly and competent staff.  That ain't easy at 6:00am with a facemask.  These folks have been vetted and the surlies, whiners and dunderheads, thrown out before the public sees them.  They are stellar.  They are happy to see you, happy to explain options, and from the kitchen to the espresso machine, know what they're concocting.\n-The pastries.  I don't know where they get them or who makes them, but they are as good as they are beautiful.  And they know how to display a bun.  None of this plastic-wrapped, I've-been-sitting-here-all-week kind of pastry display.  They grab your attention and keep it while melting in your mouth.\n-The hot fare.  For a place that focuses on mornings and lunch, they've got a fantastic variety that keeps you coming back, from a commuter egg sandwich to pancakes -- daily specials and regular items that are cooked like they've done this the right way before.  Even add some wine to your lunch party (I can't wait to do that.)\nHardware:  The cafe is inviting, not too big, a pleasing outdoor space, and the best clay coffee mugs in their retail merch shelf, as well as other coffee-making paraphernalia.\nI am fairly picky (yeah, we know, right?) and I haven't found one way to fault this establishment.  I was pleased to learn there was already one on the eastside, so they've done this all before and know what works.  \nI'm happy they've brought life to this corner of my world, and took over an old, dying and tired French bistro and reinfused it with the good vibes it deserves.  \nThe overall best thing about it is what I said initially, that it's as good as if I'd done it myself.  And thank God they are here so I don't have to.  I'd rather be a sated customer, afterall, halfway on my dogwalk, stopping for some buns, eggs and coffee, before skipping back home with my Toto on her leash.","name":"LeBuzz Caffe","address":"2930 N Swan Rd, Ste 127","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85712","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":33,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"WiFi":"u'free'","OutdoorSeating":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True"},"categories":"Breakfast & Brunch, Restaurants, Salad, Sandwiches, Coffee & Tea, Food"},{"review_id":"ZjqKC9a7QDfjhutn85MtbA","business_id":"gGCIGJcKWoPC9xZNDeX3pA","stars_x":1.0,"date":1604105892000,"text":"One star because the Eegee was delicious as usual.

The staff at this LeBuzz are not just friendly and professional, but they actually seem to care. \n\nThey are attentive not just to your needs, but to making sure everything is great once you get whatever you order. \n\nAnd when I say friendly AND professional it means a lot. There are many places, especially in Tucson, where staffs are friendly but not at all professional. After all, you're paying money at a business, you're not hanging out on the futon with that dude from down the hall. \n\nNext - atmosphere. The place is always clean, and the music is played at just the right volume. The bus tray is constantly emptied so there's never a bunch of dirty cups and plates staring at you. \n\nThe food - I've had several of their breakfast options - which are available all day - and everything I've tasted has been cooked perfectly and had terrific flavor. \n\nLeBuzz also has a massive choice of pastries and breads and they, too, have always been fresh and tasty. \n\nThe coffee -- with all due respect to the other Tucson coffeehouses I love - Caffe Luce, Cartel - the coffee at LeBuzz is my favorite. Be it the Colombian, the Guatemalan, Costa Rican, etc, I've yet to be disappointed in any mug. \n\nI just wish they'd improve their WiFi - but maybe they don't do that because they know then I'll spend even more time there!","name":"LeBuzz Caffe","address":"2930 N Swan Rd, Ste 127","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85712","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":33,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"WiFi":"u'free'","OutdoorSeating":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True"},"categories":"Breakfast & Brunch, Restaurants, Salad, Sandwiches, Coffee & Tea, Food"},{"review_id":"kRufTRCaAnOYXAg02O23Og","business_id":"bc3K8KvLkLNu_XU3RkeeeA","stars_x":5.0,"date":1638509611000,"text":"Terrific food and staff.

The frozen drinks are scooped into a cup - like ice cream - and not dispensed from a machine - which is a nice touch, I thought.\n\nI tried their flavor of the month - Peach 'n Berry and Root Beer during my visits. I have to say I was disappointed. Peach 'n Berry was bright orange and stained my mouth and it didn't taste quite like real peach OR fake peach. It was strange. The picture on the website looks like it had purple berries in it, but it just comes with normal strawberries.  The Root Beer slushie was barely passable. For some reason, it tasted like artificial sweetener to me (i.e. Splenda). My roommate got Skinny Berry, which she said was downright bad due to the strong artificial sweetener taste. My other roommate got Strawberry Lemonade, which she liked.\n\nOverall, I'm giving 3 stars because I didn't try any of their food, but the slushies were really disappointing. I would rather go to a 7-11 and get a slurpee than go here. P.S. the sizes are pretty big. I think a kid's size or small is a good size - but you can always freeze them and eat them later.","name":"eegee's","address":"1209 W St Mary's Rd","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85745","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":39,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"GoodForKids":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Alcohol":"u'none'","RestaurantsReservations":"False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","OutdoorSeating":"False","BikeParking":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","BusinessParking":"None","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': True}","Caters":"True","NoiseLevel":"'average'","HasTV":"True","DriveThru":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","ByAppointmentOnly":"False","WiFi":"'no'","WheelchairAccessible":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"True"},"categories":"Desserts, Sandwiches, Fast Food, Juice Bars & Smoothies, Restaurants, Food"},{"review_id":"9VYy_9suH88GzkE7Tbfl1Q","business_id":"bc3K8KvLkLNu_XU3RkeeeA","stars_x":3.0,"date":1581958510000,"text":"The restaurant features a bright, modern dining area with soft music playing, and two outdoor patio areas.

I do.\n\nI wish I could say the oatmeal reflected the same commitment to quality. I asked whether the oatmeal  was made with dairy -- they replied it was made with water, and a topping that included butter. They left off the topping and served me some brown sugar on the side, which was perfect, and berries. I wasn't expecting to be served what tasted like instant microwaved oatmeal and was not good at all. Very disappointing. A nice place like this should have a pot of freshly made steel cut oats for the mornings. I also tried some mango iced tea that was clearly brewed too strong (besides the taste, just look at the cloudy color to validate). They need to check with their vendor on the right tea\/water ratio.

I got the sour cream, guacamole and steak..... But with the extra surprise of eggs...... This is past 9:30 pm every time I order.... (So not breakfast time) The cashier asks if I want eggs and I always say no(and I have ended up with them every time she takes my order).... I called back and asked for a refund because it's been the third time I made the order with her and had it totally botched. All the other employees get it right every time. I asked for a phone number for a direct number for a manager, she told me I couldn't have one and if I wanted to complain I would have to call back tomorrow or someone this week (no specified time) and ask for \"meme\" or \"Pepe\". A little convenient for her that she can't tell me who can help and can't say exactly when they will be in. At the end of the call I was getting frustrated and told her she could have been more helpful, she told me she helped me and repeated my order three times ( she never repeated it, just said OK when I told her what I wanted) then told me to f#@+ off and have a nice day....... Needless to say....... I want my money for that (at least the most recent if not the three she's gotten wrong) order back. I'd settle for the most recent one but since it's been the same exact order on the same card three times in a row, and I've left a decent tip (6 dollars on a fifteen dollar carry out order) I might ask for all three to be r returned.

I can update later.\n\nMy main issue is that there is little to separate Nicos or make it unique.  I'm specifically thinking about there Carne Asada and ground beef tacos, which generally lack any real flavor in the meat.  It's as if they avoid committing to strong seasoning, which is unfortunate.  The chicken tacos on the other hand, are covered in a nice red sauce, which imparts quite a bit of flavor.  The beef? Not so much.\n\nThe refried beans are just that, refried beans, and I love them.  The rice, standard fare.\n\nListen, Nicos isn't bad, but it could be so much more.  I just moved from San Antonio, where I ate a disgusting amount of Mexican, and there is little here to make it stand out.

I ordered the Shrimp Rellenos, and it was pretty good. The shrimp was a little dry and the bacon could have been a little less 'crunchy' - I guess I would conclude that they were just a tiny bit over cooked. The cheese wasn't really gooey, which is what I was hoping for. It came with rice and a salad, both of which were good.\n\nThe atmosphere was cozy, and I liked how colorful it was on the walls. However, there were a good amount of flies in the restaurant, some which kept flying right around me and others that gravitated around my food. Needless to say, there were enough of them that caused me to lose my appetite. That was unfortunate, since I was absolutely starving.\n\nWhen we got the bill (I went with my fianc\u00c3\u00a9), they had charged us $4.00 for two salads. My meal states on the menu that it comes with a salad, and my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 ordered one as a side to his ceviche. A salad is only $2.00. He didn't bother telling our waitress since it was only $2.00 extra dollars we were being charged, but to me it's the principal of the matter. On top of that, we had to ask our server for the second salad - they didn't bring it out at all until we mentioned it.\n\nOverall, it was okay.

It is my choice for best Mexican fast food here in Tucson.  There are several NIco's on this side of town that I frequent, but currently, this one is hitting some highs for breakfast burritos.  My favorite is the Machaca breakfast burrito.  For those that don't know what that is, it is mildly spiced shredded beef grilled up with peppers, onions and tomatoes along with two eggs and cheese.  I have mine customized by asking for no cheese and adding some potatoes.  After it's grilled they roll it up in a big hot tortilla and serve it.  The Machaca is the greatest breakfast burrito of all time!  \n\nHowever, making one of these is very chef dependent.  At this location, we have young \"San Diego\" or just \"SD\"  (not his real name) running the grill.  This morning he made me the best Machaca I have ever had in Tucson and he did this before 8 a.m.  It was so hot and fresh I had to wait a few minutes before I could pick it up and start eating it.  It was soooooo good.  I love mine with the salsa verde (the green one).  This sauce perfectly compliments the spices and flavor of the Machaca.  I use between five and six of the little cups of salsa provided.  It's so good.  \n\nI ate mine in the store.

Then, I made some serious ordering errors. Mom convinced me I needed to try a michalada, which...yeah...gross. Beer, ice, tomato juice: what was I thinking? The chips were bland and cold, the small ceviche we ordered with them pretty darn good. I ordered marlin tacos, just expecting your standard fish tacos, right?

Dammit, why did I order everything wrong?? I pieced myself together some tacos with these super yummy corn tortillas, some shrimp from mom's plate, some deep fried (normal) fish from small child's plate, and a ton of that green pepper sauce, and they were pretty tasty.

We ate here on a family recommendation and it is food from the gods! Its the magically delicious food that trumps their just OK service and I still award them with a 5 star 'eating' experience.\n\nFOOD: We ordered the Micheladas, Ceviche and Camarones Culichi.\nMicheladas are kind of an acquired flavor, a mixture of beer, clamato, spices, lime juice and salt. If you know you already like them, then you'll like these a lot. If you're not sure, be safe and try someone else's.\nCeviche was served in a bowl, something new to me as I'm used to ceviche being served much dryer and on a plate. However, their Ceviche was delicious. A large order was more than enough for 4 adults as an appetizer.\nCamarones Culichi...I read another yelpers review before coming and it was spot on. It doesn't sound like the most appetizing dish but turns out this dish is a gift from the gods for your mouth! Add in the fresh tortillas, yum. This dish also come with a basic iceberg lettuce and tomato salad...which I took the larger pieces of lettuce and made lettuce wraps with!\n\nSERVICE: ...was fast but kinda lacking and unattentive. They didn't ask if we wanted more micheladas until we were ready to go. Had they asked, I probably would have had another or several. \n\nAMBIANCE: So every wall in this joint is 3 dimensional ocean themed stuff. Kinda cool especially if you like taking pictures. There tend to be live acoustic Mexican bands playing songs for tables (I say bands because I forget the name but I'm told they're not Mariachi). They charge $20\/song!!! What! I'm also told that this is how you display how much of a 'baller' you are in Tucson is by ordering up a few of these while you eat.

I'd really want to give this a higher rating than 4 but can't go up to 5.  I REALLY REALLY LOVE Mariscos Chihuahua.\n\nNote:  I believe there are 6 or 7 of these restaurants in Tucson.  I've heard they are owned by the same family but owned and run by different family members.  While the restaurants and menus look similar there are differences.  The one on 22nd doesn't serve mixed drinks.  The one on Swan accepts cash only.  There are some minor differences with the menus as well which I am less familiar with.\n\nI usually eat at the one on 22nd St.  It's a small family restaurant.  I love their Ceviche.  This is what I usually have.  It is very popular and delicious.  The Caldos 7 Mares (Seafood Soup) is delicious and packed with different seafood (shrimp, squid, octopus, sea snail (really good if you've never tried it) and white fish).  The Camarones de Culichi is very tasty.  My wife still can't stop talking about this dish!  I've always found their Oysters on the half shell to be quite delicious and fresh too.  The restaurant on Grant is the largest of the 3 that I have eaten at.  They also have these Shrimp Tacos that are insanely good.  Get them with the corn tortillas!  I just wish my usual haunt on 22nd had these tacos.  Also, the Grant location does serve mixed drinks.  Not sure about the Swan location.  \n\nTheir Micheladas are great here but they won't all be exactly the same.  I mean they'll all have the same ingredients but in different proportions as each waitress makes them differently.  Anna makes them the best at the one on 22nd!\n\nBe prepared to have extra starch with your entree as the entrees come with a small salad, white rice AND french fries.  This is authentic Mariscos (Mexican Seafood).  The great majority of customers here are Mexican or Mexican-American.  Which tells you that you may have just come to the right place for your Mexican Seafood fix.

I don't think I've ever spent more than $2.75 on cold brew EVER -- and I live in Manhattan most of the year.

The empanizados were breaded in a sweet coating and again go to any other MC and it's a reading that compliments seafood not over power the shrimp. Aqua chile is supposed to be hot and spicy not sweet and definitely not made with sweet ketchup! I added a bottled hot sauce they had, I added some of the salsa that came with chips, and I asked for more serrano Chile's to add and it barely had spice. The ketchup was too sweet for an aquachile.

Note that at least one other reviewer confuses this restaurant with another location.\n\nThe tortilla chips were fresh and warm, and the house made salsa had nice, hot flavor. \n\nThe raw oysters were fresh, but not full of flavor. The wide array of interesting sauces came in handy. \n\nThe Camarones a la Diabla were very good. The sauce was a little too greasy for my taste. The sauce was very spicy - close to my tolerance threshold (and I like very spicy food). If you prefer milder food, steer clear.\n\nSides were french fries, white rice, and salad. The fries and rice were good, and I used up some of the abundant Diabla sauce on them. The salad was iceberg lettuce and a slice of pale, watery tomato; I did not try the salad.\n\nTo address some of the negative comments in some of the other reviews:\n\n1. Tails left on shrimp.  I find this a nice presentation, like serving a lobster whole even though only parts of it will be eaten. They also serve fish with head and tail on.\n\n2. Uncleanliness.  At the time of my visit, the restaurant was neat and appeared quite clean. Having read the other reviews in advance, I tried really hard to find something amiss and managed to spot a single paper napkin on the ground in the outdoor seating area.\n\n3. Fly in the salsa and flies in the dining room. There was not a single fly in the place while I was there.\n\n4. Poor service.

I've stopped by twice for two different drinks.  The barista was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable both times and gave us some background information on the different drinks available.  The space is small (more set up for \"to go\" than \"sip and stay\"), but there are a few seats if you want to relax in the A.C.  \n\nOn my first trip, I wanted to taste the coffee, so I got a basic cafe latte with whole milk (no sugar), which was yummy.  They also have soy and almond milk options available, and we were told that despite the small menu, if you can describe the coffee drink you want, they can make it.  The barista said they are still figuring out the coffee base for their drinks; I believe she said the base right now is the Columbia brew, which I liked a lot.  For everyone who thinks coffee is yucky, there is chai tea or hot chocolate (rich, actual melted chocolate with milk instead of the powder).  \n\nOn my second trip, I tried the iced cafe de olla, which is a dreamy combination of coffee, chocolate, homemade spice syrup, and milk\/cream.  I was afraid that it would be too sweet, or that the iced version would taste weird, but I was wrong to worry on both counts.  You could taste all of the individual components of the cafe de olla, but they also married beautifully.  The chocolate tasted like a lovely, not too sweet dark chocolate, and the drink wasn't overly rich either.  As Goldilocks would say, \"Juuuust right!\"\n\nUnfortunately, they are still working out their supplier for pastries, so no baked goodies to go with your coffee just yet (unless you wander down the road to the Mercado).

This latte is super smooth, the spices aren't overpowering and compliment the bold espresso very well. It's not too sweet either, and that suits me just fine. \nI also tried a mug of their drip coffee and I think it's the perfect roast, right in between a highly acidic \"third wave\" coffee style and a bolder, richer roast. \n\nAll in all, I am really looking forward to taking advantage of their wonderful AC and wifi from now on.

I'm not usually the one to put any business on blast because I know the implications but this has gone on for far too long. My friends and I have frequented Bumsteds and Wonderwall plenty of times for those that don't know this is located next to the Best Western Royal Sun on Speedway and stone. Prior to opening I was given the opportunity to speak on the radio regarding my restaurant and as a kind gesture I made sure to mention them to hopefully evoke alittle more support because opening during the current circumstances is terrible. Needless to say we went immediately when opening , my friends and I had the worst time between the terrible cocktails made by Barb the owner of Bumsteds with no bartending experience to her being completely rude the entire time to us, a table that was spending 350+dollars on alcohol and food. After this I just assumed it was a isolated incident and decided to go back. Time and time again my friends and I are treated like garbage at the hands of Barb the owner. The other night her daughter who is a bartender literally worked the entire night WITHOUT a mask but they have the audacity to act as though they are so strict with covid 19 protocols. Last night was the final straw, I was sitting drinking and hanging out with friends, I was buying, tipping and socializing with the bartender , we were having a great time until I stood up to talk to my friend that was at the SAME table as I , I WAS wearing my mask correctly but was bombarded by Barb she said to me to (pardon my language) \" wtf are you doing sit the fuck down right the fuck now\". I was like woahhhhh okay I'll sit down I have my mask on idk what I just did to warrant her coming at me so hostile. I sat down in utter shock, a few minutes later she came back into the bar approached me, shoved her phone in my face and said \" these are messages to Tony (wonderwall owner) and my husband you are 86'd from the bar after tonight\" she got in my face flipped me off and said \"fuck you\" and stormed out. I have witnesses (customers and employees) that can verify the story. This is unacceptable as an owner and as a human being. Barb is constantly treating people terribly not just me. This place will not survive if this is the standard protocol. I reached out to Anthony Diaz owner of Wonderwall multiple times about this situation with no response back . This is not an isolated incident and many many customers have experienced the same situations with Barb at this bar\/restaurant.","name":"Bumsted's","address":"1003 N Stone Ave","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85705","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":43,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","BestNights":"{u'monday': False, u'tuesday': False, u'wednesday': False, u'thursday': False, u'friday': False, u'saturday': False, u'sunday': False}"},"categories":"Gastropubs, Restaurants, Nightlife, Bars, American (Traditional)"},{"review_id":"FFLFxZtL55AvGI_eaEDkeQ","business_id":"3ekiu6SPjwXvrizZymMqbg","stars_x":5.0,"date":1621193755000,"text":"Holy crap, this place is soooooo good!

The way the fajitas were seasoned was soooo good, I wanted a spoon to lap up the juices. I are until I could eat no more.

At first, I wasn't sure what Raising Cane's was. When I found out that they were a fried chicken joint, I assumed it would be like the rest of them- kind of rough, and very greasy. While it was business as usual, as far as chicken goes, the service, and the food were very decent.\n\nI was out with my dad last weekend, and he came up with the idea to come here. He had been the week before, and he thought it was good enough to try again. I was in the mood for trying something different, so I was game. The place was very new, so everything was immaculate, and nicely done. Thankfully, there was no country music playing when I was there; I would have been in agony if that were to be the case. \n\nThe food was very delicious. I had the 3-piece chicken tender meal, and they do basic very well.  There isn't any kind of fancy seasoning, they weren't over-fried, or under-fried, they were just perfect. And surprisingly filling- chicken strips tend to stay with me like Chinese food tends to, which isn't very long. I also really liked the sesame seed toast.\n\nThe service was another standout. Never have I ever seen workers of any fast food joint going around to other tables, asking people how their meal is, and if they could take any trash off the table. At most fast food places, you're lucky if they even get your order right, let alone help you with anything. I don't know if this is a short-lived thing because it's new or what, but if it is, bravo!\n\nRaising Cane's will be consideration for places to eat while I'm on that side of town.","name":"Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers","address":"4219 N Oracle Rd","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85705","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":41,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"DriveThru":"True","Alcohol":"u'none'","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","RestaurantsReservations":"False","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"},"categories":"Restaurants, Fast Food, Chicken Shop"},{"review_id":"jdeEdqRuiauDPAp1BPO1kw","business_id":"Fp2s3RVVvZNSqyDHLH3Q4w","stars_x":5.0,"date":1570990598000,"text":"Looks like a small place located in a strip mall, but it's a nice spacious restaurant\/bar complete with pool tables and lots of wall-mounted TV's for sports viewing.

They are newly re-opened at the Wonderwall Bar at 1003 N Stone Ave in Tucson Arizona. I loved their food when they were on 4th Avenue years ago, and I couldn't wait to try it. My boyfriend and I ordered take-out Monday evening, because corona, so we didn't stay very long. The owners and staff were very friendly in that time, and the table service looked good for the few diners that chose to sit down. They clearly care about proper sanitation, and people were physically distanced throughout the establishment. Our order was ready just fifteen minutes after we ordered. \nI ordered the MILF on wheat ($12), which comes with a generous portion of turkey, accompanied by mayo, peppered bacon, avocado, cheddar, lettuce, tomato, and a perfectly salty crunchy dill pickle spear. This may be the best sandwich ever. I honestly don't know why other sandwiches even try. I got the sweet potato fries, which were pretty amazing. I've never really been interested in them, but these were great-long and slender, and perfectly salted. They had no need of condiments whatsoever, and we devoured them. \nThe boyfriend ordered the Sloppy Kiss ($13) from the 'hot affair' region of the menu and was not disappointed.  This one consists of fried chicken, marinara, provolone and parmesan on a sub roll. He was honestly expecting the bread to be hard and too crunchy, because that happens often with toasted sandwiches, but it was toasty outside and soft inside, and covered in melty provolone. While I don't like hot sandwiches as much as he does, I have to say, this one was very tasty. Both sandwiches were large, definitely intended for someone who's properly hungry, and came with fries. Apparently there is also a choice of a side salad for those who are so inclined. \nI can't wait to go back for the El Camino burger; I ate a lot of these a decade ago when they were on 4th Avenue. I highly recommend Bumsted's for when you need a tasty sandwich\/burger fix. Definitely 5 stars.","name":"Bumsted's","address":"1003 N Stone Ave","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85705","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":43,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","BestNights":"{u'monday': False, u'tuesday': False, u'wednesday': False, u'thursday': False, u'friday': False, u'saturday': False, u'sunday': False}"},"categories":"Gastropubs, Restaurants, Nightlife, Bars, American (Traditional)"},{"review_id":"pGa1fm5w-uxcJEj9hp4HLQ","business_id":"WftO0PbmpAAcRYvwjo0_Ug","stars_x":2.0,"date":1576645333000,"text":"The customer service was lacking.

Guero's, BK's, Rollie's, Oasis, Percheron, JPS, La Estrella, just to name a few. Delicias may not be as well known but it's found its place along side other 12th Ave culinary mainstays and I'm here for it!\n\nDelicias keeps most plates simple and traditional. Classic mexican dishes packed with authentic flavor and spices. They also offer a big selection of mariscos that I've heard (and looks) to be top notch (and a $150 dinner plate when you trying to impress your Bumble date with ya pockets and espanol). To start they bring out complimentary chips and salsa and also frijoles puercos, which is refried beans with pork and a kick of chiles. Both salsa and beans were delicious. All entrees came out together and hot. I'm a sucker for shrimp and bacon so when they wrap bacon around shrimp, I'm sold. The little tastes I sampled from other plates was good as well. Looking forward to coming back to try the mariscos.\n\nDelicias is definitely a \"locals\" spot. I've been here for lunch on weekends and it has been busy. Spanish is dominate language spoken and parts of menu are in spanish only but everyone speaks English as well. People walking in to be seated would yell a hello to the people at the bar and in the kitchen. Everyone seemed friendly with one another, even if we didn't personally know them. It is a loud restaurant. If they have a band playing, it's probably going to be too loud. If there is no band, like when I visited, they had loud music playing from the big speakers near the bar. I get that that would turn some away. I would suggest sitting in the side room or away from the bar. Or start making some song requests. Never know. 4\/5*","name":"Delicias Mexican Grill","address":"4581 S 12th Ave","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85714","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":22,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsTableService":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': False, u'casual': None, u'touristy': None, u'trendy': None, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': None, u'classy': None, u'upscale': False}"},"categories":"Restaurants, Mexican"},{"review_id":"JsD39yt7gLfml9hYuCAbtw","business_id":"Fp2s3RVVvZNSqyDHLH3Q4w","stars_x":3.0,"date":1348358660000,"text":"Flat beer, crusty waitresses and nutritionally void food with enough salt to kill a horse. Yes... I am talking about a neighborhood bar and grill.\n\nIn it's former life, this used to be Famous Sam's. As a matter of fact, it wasn't until we arrived that we realized this is no longer a Famous Sams's. It does't seem like anything has changed but the name. The food still seems the same.\n\nI ordered the pulled pork sliders, which actually came from the appetizer menu and were a quite reasonable $6.35. My wife had a Chicken Caesar salad - nice that they offer a small and a large. She had the small one. My sliders were actually really good. There was flavor in the pork and they were topped with chipotle BBQ sauce which the waitress warned me was spicy, to which I said, \"bring it on!\". The sauce was not all that spicy, but had good flavor and I wished for a tiny bit more. I ordered a side of cole slaw, which by itself had no flavor at all, but when added to the sliders added that little crunch and punch. What I do remember about Famous Sam's were their fries; hand cut, cooked perfectly and seasoned to perfection. I cold probably make a meal of just those. My wife quietly ate her salad, with the exception of a few murmurs, which tells me she enjoyed it.\n\nWhoever chose the draft beer menu can't even spell IPA. The most exotic selection being George Killians. So they score no points from this IPA snob. The food, however (particularly the fries), puts this place back on my radar. It's the perfect place  to watch a game, order a (bottled) beer and eat everything your doctor tells you not to.","name":"Frank's Sports Grill & Bar","address":"7930 E Speedway Blvd, Ste 170","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85710","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","RestaurantsReservations":"False","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","OutdoorSeating":"False","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","WiFi":"u'no'","HasTV":"True","GoodForKids":"True","GoodForDancing":"False","Caters":"False","NoiseLevel":"u'loud'","Music":"{u'dj': None, u'live': False, u'jukebox': None, u'video': False, u'background_music': False, u'karaoke': None, u'no_music': False}","HappyHour":"True","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': None, u'lot': None, u'validated': False}","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': False, u'casual': True, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': False, u'intimate': False, u'romantic': False, u'classy': False, u'upscale': False}"},"categories":"Sports Bars, American (Traditional), Beer Bar, Bars, Burgers, Restaurants, Nightlife"},{"review_id":"oaydU7hBBDa-8WkaO-cTug","business_id":"Fp2s3RVVvZNSqyDHLH3Q4w","stars_x":3.0,"date":1640907692000,"text":"Sign on the door said they were \"reorganizing.\"  Not sure if they will open again or not.

We have leaned what to order and what to avoid.  Soups are not good. Do not like the tuna fish.  Nacho appetizer is great for 4 to 6 people, but add ground beef or steak or chicken (HUGE PORTION) or the warm spinach-artichoke dip with chips.  Other favorites to order include the patty melt burger with grilled onions and cheese on grilled marble rye bread (substitute American cheddar cheese for Swiss and add mushrooms), French dip roast beef sandwich, chicken wings (garlic or lemon pepper or buffalo), fried shrimp basket & fries a favorite (regular house cut without season salt is what I prefer and my wife likes to upgrade to sweet potato fries) with cocktail sauce is great, Caesar salad with grilled chicken or Chef's salad (but smaller size is ample for one person), and hot pastrami or Rueben.  It took 20 years patronizing this establishment befor we finally met the owner, and Frank is a very friendly, appreciative, and delightful guy... he just needs to get out from behind the bar (or not sit at the bar), circulate more, introduce himself to customers in the dining room, and work the room\/crowd.  We enjoyed meeting him (finally) and having him visit with us at our table. Friendly hard working servers, although when the place is packed, service can be a little slow as far as refilling drinks.  The bathrooms are in desperate need of remodeling (terrible facilities).  And the ice water tastes awful (even with added lemon slices)... really need to spend a little money on a filtered water system.\n\nUpdate. 9\/2015 significantly raised prices. No bargain. Last visit portions were much small although menu prices higher... Half the amount of fries with pastrami sandwich that definitely had much less meat than usually served, and patty melt burger meat was dry...

A large portion of hand-cut fries accompanies your burger, Reuben, pastrami, club... or what have you. If you must eat a salad in a place like this, well... they have those too.\n\nThey've improved their beer selection to keep up with the craft beer craze and  now feature a couple of crafts on tap, which includes at least one IPA. Of course, it's a bar so libation lovers aren't left out.\n\nSteelers fans note: this is your place to watch the Steelers.

We finally heard a great Blues local band. Restaurants and Bars open your doors to more live bands and note the place was hopping. People want to dance and hear live music along with great food. Thank you Famous Sam's for bringing in this group which brought in a lot of people. The band was supported by this establishment by having them start on time and having a correct room to set up the band and for the patrons to dance the night away. This band is good and Tucson should support more and more bands and get away from all the empty karaoke that we seem to see. Remember the name, \"The Coolers\",  Restaurants, you should be hiring groups like this to bring in the crowds.

This restaurant has good food. Very nice. Super creative menu and reasonably good helping sizes. Therefore it's just unfortunate that the bad things are so significant as to cause the place to be a no-go-back. First, the noise in there is absolutely horrific. Seriously I am willing to bet that it is the loudest, noisiest place in Arizona. The tables are small, and I was there with a party of 5 and we were unable to converse, even when we raised our voices. This is no exaggeration. It is unacceptable. Then, we were having Breakfast, and when we wanted more coffee we were told \"Sorry, we are out of coffee\". WTH? You run a breakfast restaurant and you run out of coffee??? As I said, the food was good (even though they do not have hash-brown potatoes, only those ikky cut up fried potatoes) and the selection choices were interesting, but no, I'll not go back because when I leave a restaurant I don't want to have ringing in my ears for the next hour from the roar that I just had to listen to - much of which was from the BLASTING MUSIC in a feeble attempt to cover the crowd noise.

Solid 3.5 for service and great food quality. Had to drop a star for the tables being covered in sauce, crumbs, and liquids. All 5 tables we tried to sit at were not cleaned of previous customer spillage. Workers behind the counter were nice, attentive, and hard working but no one was taking care of the lobby. Another issue I had with this place is the tip jar and the added tip question at checkout BEFORE any service was ever completed. Before I got my food, before I got my seat, and before any actual service was provided they were asking for a tip. Sorry, but tipping is for extra good service and this is just a fast food restaurant. You are not serving me my drink (we fill our own cups), you are not bringing my food (we all stand there waiting for you to hand it to us), there is no extra service at this store that would require a tip. Tipping is for extraordinary service of workers who are bringing you food and drinks and condiments....not for taking an order and making sandwiches. Great food, nice employees, but questionable business practices. In this same theory of tipping you are suggesting we should tip any business that takes has a register...like McDonalds, Sonic, or Subway.","name":"Jersey Mike's Subs","address":"9172 S Houghton Rd, Ste 150","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85747","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":44,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","HasTV":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True"},"categories":"Restaurants, Delis, Sandwiches, Fast Food"},{"review_id":"QcZ9b5pwJyVommJu-y3bEQ","business_id":"n15FxktkJgkdIrkgZllEfQ","stars_x":5.0,"date":1533775264000,"text":"We were waiting for this place to open and now that is has we're in heaven!

I have a mask on...the employees have a mask on...there is a plexiglass partition between us...and then there is the music on at full blast.  Why?  Just to irritate the customers and employees?  Everyone is yelling at each other because no one can hear.  Today I ordered my sandwiches.  Then the trouble began.  I suspect the woman making the sandwiches was having a bad day.  She was working very rapidly.  She was banging the oil and vinegar bottles down on the counter adding to the noise.  Other than asking if I wanted \"Mikes Way\" she didn't ask what I wanted on the sandwiches.  She threw them together very rapidly and then I had to ask her to go back and make changes because she didn't stop to hear, or couldn't hear what I wanted.  Then she gave me attitude.  My sandwich was a CA Club which has avocado and bacon on it...one piece of bacon.  I asked for one additional piece of bacon and she broke in half the one piece she had already put on the sandwich.  I then asked for another whole piece of bacon...for which I was charged $1.  Finally I got out of there...I believe this is my last visit to Jersey Mike's.  I really just don't need the aggravation.  Also, they don't enforce their mask policy, and a few days ago my husband was charged twice for the same order.","name":"Jersey Mike's Subs","address":"9172 S Houghton Rd, Ste 150","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85747","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":44,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","HasTV":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True"},"categories":"Restaurants, Delis, Sandwiches, Fast Food"},{"review_id":"LboZcDwGUcsQAndYXQFYKQ","business_id":"n15FxktkJgkdIrkgZllEfQ","stars_x":1.0,"date":1596656449000,"text":"I have placed numerous take out orders and almost every single one of them have been made incorrectly.

A good churros is crispy on the outside, and very moist in the middle. With that being said, here's what I loved about this place. It's large, well decorated, and comfortable. The service was friendly and quick. They take Covid precautions seriously and I felt safe. The menu isn't huge, but it has some fun items. The kids were thrilled. The dipped churros are pretty big.\n\nI wanted to try a filled churro, but they are smaller and I had been craving an original cinnamon-sugar churro. My kids got the marshmallow churro and the white chocolate Oreo. We got a smore sandwich to share.\n\nThe original- I said I was picky. First of all, they are pretty skinny, and I think that is why it was cooked fully ask the way thru, with a dry center. Second, it tasted slightly like refrigerator biscuits. The outside was nice a crispy, but it was low on cinnamon, imo.\n\nThe marshmallow churro. This was probably the winner. It looks dramatic, and my marshmallow-loving kid was in heaven.\n\nWhite chocolate Oreo. My son looooves white chocolate. Unfortunately, he couldn't taste any here. It was like a very watered down white chocolate dip that was very thin, and only had enough on it to keep the Oreo dust on it. He was disappointed, but still loved it.\n\nThe smore sandwich was a huge disappointment. They use a kitchen torch to burn the marshmallow AND the chocolate. Straight up ash. Not tasty, and the churro patties didn't taste fresh. They were soft. Half of this is still sitting on my counter, and I have three kids at home.\n\nSo overall, if you aren't picky, want a sugar rush, and enjoy novelty, definitely visit.","name":"King Churro","address":"1800 East Fort Lowell Rd, Ste 116","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85719","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":30,"is_open":1,"attributes":null,"categories":"Desserts, Food, Juice Bars & Smoothies, Cafes, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"BcwryiSqrP2tR5XTmOjFAg","business_id":"C9PVoSSpmncXgzmAKuLr7A","stars_x":4.0,"date":1601179727000,"text":"This was located in the strip mall by Skechers store.

Hot subs cold, meat over cooked and dry, more veggies than meat just to name a few of the rotating issues we see every single time. Don't get a salad or anything in a \"bowl\" to go. They'll seal it up and then set it on its side in a bag for you......so all the juice or dressing leaks out, soaks the bag and gets all over your seats it or the bottom rips out when you pick the bag up and all your food goes spilling out.\n\nTonight we ordered our food and I left to pick it up, got there and was told it would be ready in just a moment, they were almost done with it. I waited another 30 minutes before I left with my food. Was told twice it was almost ready even though I saw it sitting on the counter and then was just ignored, the people wouldn't even make eye contact with me after that. Even had a couple who came in after me, finish their food and then ask me why was I still waiting? Finally, one of the girls who was there while I was waiting, went on break, came back and saw me still standing there waiting asked me if I got my order. Then picked up the food I'd been looking at for 10 minutes into the bag, oh yeah, 3 bowls, all in the bag sideways so all the food was bunched up on one end and juice coming out, asked for a new bags as you could see them already absorbing liquid.

It's nicer than most of the caretas in our area but still fits in and makes it comfortable for the locals to come and chill to enjoy their food. The meat quality was really good and for how many little taco shops there are in this area it's great they are still able to stand out with their food.

I had driven quite a bit and didn't know this place was right under my nose. They're currently running a Friday take out special. The first special I heard about was the Hot Chicken sandwich. I was disappointed to have missed out on that one, but I couldn't eat meat that day. \n\nThis week's special was meatloaf with mushroom gravy, mashed potatoes, roasted veggies and a chocolate mousse. I arrived a few minutes prior to my pick up time. The way the pick up was set up wasn't too clear so I had several people asking me about pick up. My order was put together on time and handed to me. I asked if everything was in there including plasticware and I was told yes. I should have checked, but it wasn't in there. \n\nThe mousse was well prepared, but poorly packaged as more of the whipped cream ended up on the lid than the mousse. They could have put the same quantity in a larger container as they did with the other dishes. The meatloaf was good, but not the best I've ever had. Restaurant or takeout meatloaf is a challenge because you don't really want pooling grease, but you also want to avoid dry meat loaf. This wasn't dry, but it wasn't moist. It missed the window slightly. The portion size is generous for the price. This was a good meal at a good price.

I was concerned they were going to miss something with my order, but the burrito was made just as I ordered and the burrito exceeded my expectations. The contents of the burrito complemented each other so well and each component was well prepared. The beef had a great flavor. The bacon was so well placed on the burrito it didn't unintentionally fall off the burrito and the bacon was cooked perfectly, not too soggy or too burnt to be wrapped around a burrito.

Absolutely blown away with basically everything. The service was prompt and punctual, and very kind. If you get Wesley, you are in luck, as he makes a pretty insane espresso martini, which I would greatly recommend. The owner, Christina, who was sitting next to us working on some business paperwork, seemed like a really nice lady, and even gave us some suggestions on the newly redone menu. The interior was well lit, and well stocked with board games (we played Azul and Clank!, the latter of which is complicated but I would recommend to everyone).\n\nOn to the food and drink, my friend ordered a Greyhound, and literally could not stop. He's really not much of a drinker, so it definitely surprised me. It then surprised me a little more when he ordered the table an entire pitcher of the Rum Punch, which was, while very rum forward, perfectly mixed, tasty, and garnished with an entire chopped lemon. It was extremely good! We got some fries and cheesy bread, and although the portions were modestly sized, the quality of the food accounts for it in SPADES. Like, legitimately, they were the best, fluffiest, and crispiest fries I've had a long time. My other friend with a notorious sweet tooth got a chocolate mouse, which came out in this three tiered caramel, chocolate crumble, and graham crumble, and the presentation really blew me away. She also got a lavender vanilla latte, which was surprising floral and pleasant. Very nice! \n\nIn all, I really had nothing to complain about. Everyone was extremely generous, the board game stock was plentiful, the atmosphere was cozy and fun, and prices were more than reasonable.

So I ordered a few drinks (11\/27\/21). Lol.\n\n+ Margarita ($8) - was supposed to be spicy, but wasn't.\n+ Cartnitas tacos ($11) - my 8-year-old really enjoyed them with the green salsa\n+ Red Light burger (18) - comes with a poblano pepper and fries... ordered a medium rare one for me which I absolutely devoured. A well-done one for my 7-year-old. She surprisingly ate all of her burger. It was big. Lol.\n+ Sunset Cooler ($8)  - it was better than the margarita. It entailed \"gin, grapefruit, lemon, hibiscus, and campari.\"\n+ Flan ($5) - it was alright. My girls enjoyed it.\n+ Night Cap ($10) - they allowed me to take this concoction of \"mezcal, cacao bourbon, meletti amaro, and amargo vallet bitters\" back to our room.\n+ 2 Sprites for the girls with good carbonation ($2 each)\n\nLITTLE YELPER'S CLUB\nThere is no kid's menu, but I made do with my 7 and 8-year-olds because I have always raised them to try new foods. \n\nPARKING\nThere is minimal lot parking not exactly reserved for paying customers of the hotel rooms - as I was not asked what vehicle I drove. Some street spots too. \n\nTIPS\nOrder at the bar. Face masks are not required if you're fully-vaccinated for COVID-19.\n\n| Food: 4 | Service: 4 | Environment: 4 | Price: 3 |","name":"Red Light Lounge","address":"485 S Stone Ave","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85701","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":22,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': None, u'casual': True, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': True, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': True, u'classy': True, u'upscale': None}","BYOB":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","HasTV":"True","BestNights":"{u'monday': False, u'tuesday': False, u'wednesday': False, u'thursday': False, u'friday': False, u'saturday': False, u'sunday': False}","RestaurantsReservations":"True","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","WheelchairAccessible":"True","DogsAllowed":"True","WiFi":"u'free'","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","Smoking":"u'outdoor'","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","OutdoorSeating":"True"},"categories":"Wine Bars, Cocktail Bars, American (New), Bars, Nightlife, Lounges, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"VimTLhfqAJtX5wNhfiH8Cg","business_id":"QILVJ9Goa3Lujk7B_lPQmw","stars_x":2.0,"date":1599166774000,"text":"Lemme just say I hate writing reviews like this but my words are for the people because they need to know alright? Ok so i ordered a burger from Stackd for takeout one day because I was STARVING and figured hey why not get local rather than Carl's Jr because that's kinda what I was craving. I ordered the Wild West burger, an order of onion rings, and a shake. The best part of my meal was the onion rings. They were crispy regular onion rings. My burger though was just a regular burger. I have to say for 9 bucks and looking at the photos on yelp I expected a lot more. The patty just tasted like a frozen grilled burger. There was  nothing special. Don't get me wrong my food wasn't bad or anything but it wasn't good either if that makes sense. It was like in the middle but for the price I was expecting a 360 dunk of flavor you know what I'm sayin. The photos and price point really just oversold the product. I was expecting Jordan and Pippen and got whoever played second string. I will say the bun they used for the burger was really good though. It was nice and fluffy not your average fast food burger bun. There are some of my favorite burger joints in town in this area so I would say Stack'd really needs to step their game up.

Holy moly - this meal was incredible!\nNow, my husband's meal - just like Tucson, this burger had a nice spice.  A chorizo patty and regular burger patties (when I say regular, that just means some of the finest beef in town), green chiles, pepper jack, bacon, shredded lettuce, pickles, and Thunder sauce between those signature buns is just a work of culinary chicanery that blows the mind!!!

Located right on 4th, it is very easy to find, but there is only metered parking.  There is a tram that goes right by so I suppose you could also catch the tram and stop right out front if you want to avoid the metered parking.\n\nThere is a vary simple menu with burgers only and not too many choices (No salads or anything like that). All the burgers are $12.99 and come with fries but you can substitute tater tots or sweet potato fries for $1 more.\n\nSeating inside is varied, there are some tables that seat 2-4, and there are plenty of counters with taller chairs.  The artwork is interesting with some fluorescent colors and some funny pictures.\n\nThe person taking the orders was friendly and helpful and she also delivered the food when it was ready. I think Lindy was in the back cooking the burgers. Compliments to the chef owner for his tasty creations.\n\nI tried the Big Kahuna burger and it was delicious. Moist and juicy and a little pink inside, not over cooked at all and very tasty. It is a little messy but the tables have a whole roll or paper towels for you.  The buns have a thunder bolt stamped into them too.\n\nThe sweet potato fries were crisp and tasty exactly how I like them.\n\nI think it took me about 5 minutes to devour the whole meal partially because I was hungry, but mostly because I could not stop eating it.\n\nNo tap water available but the bottled water and cans of soda are only $1 so that is a good bargain.\n\nDefinitely stop in and try if you are nearby and in the mood for a tasty burger creation.","name":"Thunder Bacon Burger","address":"621 N 4th Ave","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85705","stars_y":5.0,"review_count":25,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsTableService":"False","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","Alcohol":"u'beer_and_wine'","Caters":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': True, u'lot': False, u'validated': False}","RestaurantsReservations":"False","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': None, u'casual': True, u'touristy': None, u'trendy': None, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': False, u'classy': None, u'upscale': False}","RestaurantsDelivery":"True"},"categories":"American (Traditional), Gastropubs, Restaurants, Burgers"},{"review_id":"2Sl20aaevKCWTRki-_rawQ","business_id":"3gqB-N60ePaggR3JzkRgEg","stars_x":5.0,"date":1636491292000,"text":"Lindy not only creates the perfect burger, but incorporates his creativity and innovation in each original menu item. \n \nA true Tucson staple.","name":"Thunder Bacon Burger","address":"621 N 4th Ave","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85705","stars_y":5.0,"review_count":25,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsTableService":"False","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","Alcohol":"u'beer_and_wine'","Caters":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': True, u'lot': False, u'validated': False}","RestaurantsReservations":"False","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': None, u'casual': True, u'touristy': None, u'trendy': None, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': False, u'classy': None, u'upscale': False}","RestaurantsDelivery":"True"},"categories":"American (Traditional), Gastropubs, Restaurants, Burgers"},{"review_id":"7F4hZ_cnVGrpukxYzDPWBg","business_id":"3gqB-N60ePaggR3JzkRgEg","stars_x":5.0,"date":1635276110000,"text":"Burger lovers take note this is the real deal!

I got the burger with all the recommended toppings and I felt they all worked perfectly to give you that island taste.  \n\nI was totally between ordering the Totchos or chili cheese fries but since I haven't had good chili in a while, i had to follow my heart and go with the chili cheese fries.  My wife and me scarfed these down fast.  Nothing fancy about it, just nice crispy fries and some damn good chili and cheese sauce.    \n\nAlthough I'll miss eating poke burritos, their new menu holds up strongly in my eyes.

This place instantly became one of my go-to's before Tucson Roadrunners hockey games!\n\nI have visited TBB twice so far and have had an amazing experience both times! It's clean, open, filled with local art, and the bathroom sign made me laugh - \"we don't care how you identify, just please wash your hands!\" It's easy to see from the counter that the kitchen is spotless and I got to meet the Tucson Culinary Legend himself, Lindy Reilly, both times!\n\nThe first burger I had was the \"Farlow BAMF\" - this thing is a boneless smoked rib patty, cooked on the grill with whiskey along side two other smash-patties and bacon. Then he added bacon jam (what?!), cheese, and sauce... and then served it on one of the best buns I've ever had. Super cool branded (literally branded) buns from a local bakery.\n\nThe second burger I ate was the the Long Duk Dong (a nod 16 Candles). This was a double smash-patty with crab wonton filling (with legit crab chunks in it), fried wonton strips and a delicious sweet\/spicy chili sauce. This was the \"burger of the month\" but it was so good I'm going to have to go by one more time before they change it.\n\nI've had disappointing burgers on 4th Avenue that have pushed me toward other types of food when I'm there, but now I've found a place that is absolutely legit. I'm already looking forward to this weekend's hockey games so I can bring my family to eat at Thunder Bacon Burger!\n\nDefinitely a 5-star review...

It's a space where you can order food, drinks from the bar, and Presta Coffee. Their staff was friendly and the food was really good. \n\nSince they're a chain with locations in Tempe and Canada I wasn't sure how the food quality would be but I was pleasantly surprised. I would say their food prices are a bit high for Tucson and the seats\/booths weren't comfortable enough for hours of playing games. When the food is higher priced and you add a a $5 game fee per person, plus drinks (even non-alcoholic).. it can add up quickly. It would be nice if the game fee was waived with a minimum food spend per person. The prices could very much be because of their location on University Blvd. They do have a good price on Presta coffee though!\n\nOn weekend nights and as they get busier in the fall they will have a \"game master\" on staff to help you learn to play new games. It's nice to know if you take on a game you've never seen before someone friendly can help you and your group figure it out.\n\nOverall, Snakes and Lattes is a wonderful addition to the University area but the prices would lead me to probably just playing games and drinking a coffee next time.","name":"Snakes & Lattes Tucson","address":"988 E University Blvd","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85719","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":31,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsTableService":"True","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","OutdoorSeating":"False","BikeParking":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","HasTV":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","WiFi":"u'free'","BYOB":"False","BestNights":"{u'monday': False, u'tuesday': False, u'wednesday': False, u'thursday': False, u'friday': False, u'saturday': False, u'sunday': False}","WheelchairAccessible":"True"},"categories":"American (New), Nightlife, Coffee & Tea, Cafes, Restaurants, Bars, Food"},{"review_id":"bW2BdLNucGxu4SIBF-ai4g","business_id":"UWj1wJFLWCfqVN3Z6gg2DA","stars_x":5.0,"date":1621912945000,"text":"They've kept this daring place alive through the pandemic & quality is excellent! \n\nThe menu is small, well thought out with fresh ingredients.

In fact, this place is superior to some independent burger restaurants around the Tucson Metro area.\n\nUpon arrival on my very first visit to any Five Guys I was immediately surprised to learn about the free peanuts. Now, it does seem a bit interesting to know that a diner that specializes in serving delicious beef  patties betwixt two tasty buns (hehe) would hand out free peanuts, but I was grateful that this happened because I love peanuts. \n\nThe danger is consuming too many. For starters, you need to leave room for your food because it's ultimately well worth it. But too many peanuts make my stomach hurt and I am not sure the combination of peanuts and greasy ground beef would be something my digestive system would take too kindly too. Either way, the free peanuts are a good appetizer (because they're free, duh) in moderation. \n\nThe lavish burger patties were cooked to absolute and unquestionable perfection. The cheese was melted perfectly (meaning that it was melted but not runny) and the lettuce had a very fresh taste to it and added a soft crunch to the beefy goodness. \n\nAs a fan of all sorts or french fries, so I don't necessarily dislike any restaurant's version so long as they are cooked well.  These ones are freshly cut with the potato skins left on and the seasoning used gives them a fantastic salty aura. \n\nConsidering I live back on the far east side of town again, this Five Guys' location certainly has my approval and backing going forward.","name":"Five Guys","address":"9484 E 22nd St, Ste 110","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85710","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":46,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"NoiseLevel":"'average'","BikeParking":"True","Caters":"False","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","WiFi":"u'no'","RestaurantsReservations":"False","HasTV":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Alcohol":"u'none'","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","GoodForKids":"True","DriveThru":"False","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': True}","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"},"categories":"Restaurants, Burgers, Fast Food, American (New), American (Traditional)"},{"review_id":"nKgN87kTBTdQXaMp37MEzg","business_id":"qTIgeBp_dR5Rvi0XWJMW4g","stars_x":5.0,"date":1531770131000,"text":"Second time at this location, honestly not sure why I dont go more often.

The location is smaller than most other that I've been in, but it works.  They have it set up well.  Like every other FIve Guys, you walk in and get in line.  Their menu, to me, can be a little bit intimidating because they have so many topping choices, but it's easy to get used to.  Place your order, grab some peanuts, get a drink, and have a seat.  It usually takes a couple of minutes to get your food, but they're making everything to order, so the wait is welcomed.\n\nThe burgers are tasty.  They're not the biggest, but they are juicy and have a good flavor.  The bacon was ok and they put a good amount of it.

The potatoes arrive at each location as a potato, not already cut into fries and frozen.  You can taste the freshness.  They fry them to a perfect golden brown, which gets them nice and crispy on the outside, but soft and yummy on the inside.  They're just good.  And, as most people who know anything about Five Guys already knows, they give you a TON of fries.  One small order should be enough to feed about three adults.  My husband and I share a small and we always end up throwing some out.\n\nThis location is very clean.  They had one employee dedicated to just cleaning tables and floors, and he was doing a great job.  The bathrooms were also very clean.

Limited menu is smart, burgers, hot dogs, fries and a couple of other things. Five Guys is a slow take on fast food; that is it takes a little longer for your order because your burgers and dogs don't go onto the grill until you order them. That distinguishes them from some other burger joints that batch burgers and fries thru and then heat lamp them for a while until someone places an order. Freshly cooked fresh ingredients make a difference! (One of the reviews posted on their wall says, \"not a freezer in the joint,\" and I certainly didn't see any evidence of a freezer!)\n\nStaff is friendly, facilities are super clean and pricing is very reasonable.\n\nIt's important to note that complimentary roasted in-shell peanuts are offered for on-site consumption at most locations, with signage alerting potential customers who may have a peanut allergy.

There was a five top\/table of five who were pretty grumpy and after they had sat down (at an appropriately designated table) began to complain about too many people too close together. I disagree. They were so grumpy that even the accompanying four-year-old child was in a bad mood. That says something. The \"fun suckers\" made the world a better place by going outside to eat. There are even accommodations for \"fun suckers.\"  To make my point again, there was plenty of distancing between tables. If one feels uncomfortable eating in public there's always the \"to go\" option. I was glad that this party found seating outside and they took their negative vibe with them.

My wife and I have been to all manner of gluten free bakeries in several states. We both agreed that this one of the better ones. We were a little bummed because they were out of several of the items we wanted to try after reading other Yelp reviews. What we did end up with was awesome and I will rate them below. \n\nThe cafe itself is cute. It seems like it would be fun to hang out in if it wasn't during COVID. Right now they are taking all the usual recommended measures. In addition to the Decor, They also have a gender neutral restroom.\n\nThe prices are on par with most of the other gluten free places in town. The number of choices are similar to a local coffee shop. They serve coffee drinks, some sandwiches, salads and basic breakfast.  We decided not to purchase any food because they don't make their own bread. It would be awesome if the owner came up with some good bread recipies (sandwich, English muffins etc.) because the baked goods are awesome. Or perhaps come up with more creative options if they're going to continue to use canyon bake house. I can just make most of the same food at home cheaper. But if you're looking to hang out, it's not a bad choice.\n\nBaked goods we tried:\nToffee cookie. 7\/10. Like most gf places this is a crunchy cookie. Great flavor but really, really crunchy!\n\nApple fritter. 10\/10. Uh...they nailed this one. Better than most gluten fritters I've had. And I've had many.  would be nice if it was a tiny bit bigger so you'd get more of the soft middle part.\n\nCarrot cake cupcake- 9\/10. This was awesome! Soft and moist at room temp. Lots of real carrot and great frosting.\n\nOreo cupcake. 9\/10. Features new gf Oreo.

The patty is perfectly grilled. \n3. Meat to bun ratio: The patty was perfect for the bun and extremely juicy. There was no left over bun or burger. \n4. Included extras (veggies \/ condiments): There is no standard extras as all their extras are free.

However, there is no way they're worth almost $2 per wing. This is by far the most expensive wing I've ever had. Their \"medium\" is the equivalent of a \"hot\" at most other places, so be warned if you're a person who can't take much heat. The package was also extremely hot - so much so that I burned my skin taking it out of the bag and trying to carry it. A little warning would have been nice, or at least a container that doesn't transmit the heat directly to whatever it touches. I had asked for them extra crispy, since the cashier offered things like extra crispy or extra saucy. The wings weren't crispy at all. I think if you're going to specialize in something like this, and charge almost twice as much as anyone else - and 3 times the cost of the pizza we got from somewhere else at the same time - then these better be the best I've ever tasted.

It's definitely more than a bakery and the food does indeed remind me of a patisserie. \n\nI've only had a celiac diagnosis for a few years so I fondly and at times, longingly, remember the delicious taste of wheat. GF baking is not for the faint of heart. It is finicky, particular and at times, feels near impossible. \n\nI had the quiche today and it was fantastic. Broccoli, bacon and cheese all layered on a delicious crust that was reminiscent of its gluten filled counterpart. \n\nThe Apple fritters are really good and one of our favorites. The churros are a generous size and delicious. \n\nWe tried the sugar cookies at Christmas and I was thrilled- they were very good. \n\nThe main challenge I've found with GF stuff is that it's either dry\/dense like a hockey puck, or gritty\/sandy from too much rice flour. You won't find any of that here. I'm always hesitant to try new GF places. It feels like in many instances you have to trade safe food for flavor. You're so happy to find a place where you can safely eat, that you're willing to let things slide like taste, texture and flavor. Again, definitely not the case at Zeal. Not only can celiacs safely enjoy the food here, it's delicious food. \n\nI'm so thankful to have a delicious east side GF option. My kids are thrilled to have a safe new place for treats.

Gluten-free bakery it is not. My $11 sandwich, which was the size of my palm and dripped everywhere (egg yolk is bomb diggity on a plate, but if it's in a sandwich and you're not expecting it, it's bad news--warn a girl, maybe? Drip drip drip. Egg sandwiches should be firm!), was made on Canyon Bakehouse bread. Canyon Bakehouse is good. You know how I know? I buy it at Sprouts all the time. How are you calling yourself a bakery when you aren't making your bread? I could have bought an entire loaf, plus a dozen eggs, plus a half-pound of bacon, for what I paid for the single sandwich.\n\nThe staff working the front, Hannah (woo! twins!) and a boy whose name I didn't catch, were very pleasant but pretty obviously new to having jobs at all (everybody is new to a job at some point! That's allowed! Not a ding, just something that affected the experience) and to knowing what gluten is. Since I'm also allergic to other things, I had questions about ingredients, and it was obvious from their hesitancy that they didn't just not know the ingredients off the top of their head (not actually a problem) but that they didn't know what gluten was (a problem), because the answer I got to \"so what is in your bread that you call rye bread?\" was \"just the regular rye ingredients.\" Rye is by definition NOT gluten-free. So what's in the bread? Idk; I went with Canyon Bakehouse. I don't expect the whole world to be intimately familiar with what gluten is, but I do expect that a company marketing itself as gluten-free would have employees who know how that works. \n\nThe churros were dope af, and I'm glad they ended up being free of the other ingredients I'm allergic to--I had to take a chance, because I couldn't really count on the employees or the owner, who was relaying information from the kitchen. The brewed coffee advertised was not available, but I will chalk that up to new business growing pains and, well, covid has made everything ridiculous, so I don't hate on anybody for having less availability of stuff. Then again, maybe that's why you don't open a new business in the middle of a pandemic? \nThen AGAIN, maybe I shouldn't have been going out at all, so I can't judge much. (Though to their credit, they have signs and stuff telling you where you can and can't sit, everybody's wearing masks, etc. No complaints about hygiene and sanitation.) \n\nMy americano was real bitter, which sounds like a joke if you read my paragraph about Eurocentrism below, but it's actually a barb because what I mean is the espresso was not all that great.\n\nAtmosphere? Friendly. The look? Very precious, and with that long galley that will make it crowded once it's busy, which is kind of what you want in your *coffee shop.* The decor is so on point with the vaguely French aesthetic we so love in Murica that it's almost...antiseptic? Too pure. Too much of a complete set. I can't quite put my finger on it. Also, their adorable indoor signage spelled \"pastries\" wrong and it's still bothering me a week later. The soundtrack is coffee shop x jazz standards, which bothered me: the former is why you shouldn't call your business a patisserie just to get points for Eurocentrism when you're actually just a caf\u00c3\u00a9, and the latter is already the vibe at Dedicated, Tucson's #1 gf joint, which, after my experience at Zeal, remains without a challenger.","name":"Zeal Patisserie","address":"1525 N Wilmot Rd","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85712","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":41,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Caters":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","WheelchairAccessible":"True","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': None, u'lot': True, u'validated': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True"},"categories":"Gluten-Free, Breakfast & Brunch, Restaurants, Desserts, Cafes, Cupcakes, Bakeries, Custom Cakes, Food"},{"review_id":"gHj-HJh_3XQrLopG-mp8nQ","business_id":"qTIgeBp_dR5Rvi0XWJMW4g","stars_x":4.0,"date":1481294660000,"text":"This 5 Guys is pretty close to me so I go here semi-regularly.\nI have never had an issue with the food or the staff and I think the burgers are pretty good.

I'm sad to say this one fell short and disappointment. \nCalled in for 18 wings, large fries ATL style, celery and ranch. The girl over the phone was polite but she isn't familiar with the menu, granted she said it was her first day. Which is fine. I got the 6 Honey Habernero, 6 Chipotle BBQ and 6 Chipotle Hot. Let me tell now, none of these were HOT. More towards the medium side. The wings was hard and dry. BUT the sauce was amazing and flavorful. Still not enough for the dry wings. The french fries was the WORST! Super dry, felt like it was over cook in the AIR FRYER. Also, they only gave us one little container of ranch for 18 WINGS. \nThere was also a lack of communication from the staff letting us know where to go to pick up our order. Left side had tables and a bar and the right side is what looks like where you place your order and pay. After waiting for a bit a girl told us to go to the other side where the bar is, in the back will be where we pick up our order. I just thought that was a little odd since there is a waiting\/pick up area inside. \nOverall, I hope to give them another shot when we are craving some wings, maybe it was just a bad day.","name":"ATL Wings","address":"5855 E Broadway Blvd","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85711","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":39,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BikeParking":"True","WiFi":"u'no'","HasTV":"True","DogsAllowed":"True","Smoking":"u'no'","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","WheelchairAccessible":"True","DriveThru":"False","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': False, u'lot': True, u'validated': False}","Caters":"True","BusinessAcceptsBitcoin":"False","OutdoorSeating":"True","CoatCheck":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"True","Corkage":"False","BYOB":"False","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","HappyHour":"True"},"categories":"Local Flavor, Sports Bars, Chicken Wings, Nightlife, American (Traditional), Restaurants, Bars, Food"},{"review_id":"GNnWdGbWN5ml0UxC8sjzkA","business_id":"QwptQh7cN9NQK3YHaTxe4g","stars_x":5.0,"date":1632682762000,"text":"Just had some takeout wings for a football Sunday.

I stoped a server who was walking by my table with a full pot of coffee in her hand and had to ask her for a refill. I would recomend that if the lady who was walking back and forth from the FOH to the BOH is the manager she should be on the floor when the restaurant is busy refilling coffee and talking to the gust so she would know how bad service is. I would also recomend that if a server has coffee in her hand hit every table she passes.

Saw a new place in town and all 5 star reviews (lies, or from nut jobs)\nEverything was frozen. Started with the calamari and it's served with the Mae Poy chili sauce. Remind you it's an Italian restaurant. Calamari was blatantly frozen and not sure about the Panko crumbs....\nAlso got the carpaccio. Too many capers which made it salty. Served with several baby tomatoes uncut. Lazy chef who didn't think of dicing them perhaps? \nEntrees were a disgrace! The veal tasted like chicken fried steak smothered in a salty and sour cheese that I scrapped off. The polenta was a rectangle and also not fresh. Burnt asparagus along with a vegetable medley that was probably frozen but not cooked well. Is it hard to saut\u00c3\u00a9 fresh vegetables with olive oil and some basic seasoning?

It was a good decision. \n\nWe were sat at a nice window table and everyone was inviting and friendly. We told them we had just over an hour to eat, they made it work, and the timing was pretty good. \n\nI had a glass of wine and my husband had an Italian soda. We were given bread with olive oil and vinegar but we didn't get a chance to try it. \n\nThe menu isn't large but there were many good options. We thought the prices were good, especially after we saw the portion sizes and tasted the food. We decided to start with soup (lobster bisque) and a salad then share an entree. The soup and salad were large and good. Either of these items would have made a nice light meal. The cod entree was delicious. We paid a $2 split plate fee for the cod and it was worth it.

Of course we compared every experience here to when it was the wonderful Cafe Milano so the bar is set high.\n\nMy  first hint that this wasn't going to be a great experience was the bread - cold, tasteless and something that could have come off the shelf at Costco.  We, of course did not come for the bread so onto the main courses.\n\nWe ordered the Bruschetta as an appetizer and although I know it is served with the toppings cold, the bread is normally right off the grill and still warm but it all tasted like it had been refrigerated before serving.  \n\nI'm trying to eat a little lighter so just ordered the lobster bisque which was quite good.  Very little lobster pieces but a nice overall flavor, rich on the tongue and a generous portion considering it's only $7.00.\n\nMy wife's chicken on the other hand was a terrible presentation.  If you're going to sous vide your chicken, take a few minutes to then add a little color to it on the grill or even with a chef's torch.  Putting a pale white piece of food on a plate just doesn't stir the gastronomic juices.\n\nAs to drinks - draft Dragoon was perfectly chilled and served in the proper glass.  My wife ordered a split of Proseco and instead got a split of champagne which she said was okay but not what she was really in the mood for.\n\nMy wife decided to try the Tiramisu and said that it was the best part of our whole meal so thumbs up for that.\n\nOverall, a disappointing and not inexpensive dinner.  Atmosphere was nice, staff was friendly and attentive and the place is obviously trying to make itself into a named restaurant but they have a ways to go with the quality of the food, presentation and preparation.  We hope they survive because it is so convenient to the Fox and we go there often for live shows.","name":"Perche\u00e2\u0080\u0099 No Italian Bistro","address":"46 W Congress St","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85701","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":29,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","HappyHour":"True","Music":"{u'dj': None, u'live': False, u'jukebox': None, u'video': False, u'background_music': False, u'karaoke': None, u'no_music': False}","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"None","BestNights":"{u'monday': False, u'tuesday': False, u'wednesday': False, u'thursday': False, u'friday': False, u'saturday': False, u'sunday': False}","RestaurantsTableService":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': None, u'street': None, u'lot': False, u'validated': None}","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': None, u'casual': True, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': None, u'intimate': True, u'romantic': True, u'classy': None, u'upscale': None}","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'"},"categories":"Bars, Food, Gluten-Free, Coffee & Tea, Nightlife, Wine Bars, Restaurants, Italian"},{"review_id":"VF8TypWylz0kOW6uZ9ii8w","business_id":"lnwjN23RJA1kjoOX0NNKxw","stars_x":5.0,"date":1636135951000,"text":"Their sandwiches are top notch and the staff is very respectful and nice I highly recommend this place if you want a great sandwich with great flavor..","name":"Hogie House","address":"5810 E 22nd St","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85711","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":37,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsReservations":"False","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","OutdoorSeating":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","BikeParking":"True","GoodForKids":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","NoiseLevel":"'quiet'","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","HasTV":"True","Caters":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","Alcohol":"u'none'"},"categories":"Sandwiches, Fast Food, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"_xOa1QPY6j8EIwu78inTKA","business_id":"lnwjN23RJA1kjoOX0NNKxw","stars_x":5.0,"date":1417802469000,"text":"Local Business been holding it down since 1959 in Tucson.

If you are looking for underwhelming Italian food at a reasonable price, then this is the place for you.  I started out with Lobster Bisque soup which I thought was way too thick.  I'm an East Coast transplant so I know my seafood dishes.  Lobster Bisque is meant to be more of a delicate soup with a lot of rich flavor.  This soup just did not cut it.  My next course was the Caprese Salad. The tomatoes were underripe and had no flavor.  If you can't get flavorful tomatoes to use  in a tomato salad, you shouldn't serve this salad at all.  Using heirloom tomatoes would have greatly improved the taste of this salad; instead, all the flavor came from their balsamic glaze and the basil which was the topping on the tomatoes and the cheese.  My next course was the Pork Scallopine with mushrooms and a balsamic creamy sauce.  What a surprise when it arrived as two large chewy pork chops which were pounded not so thin.  The typical Pork Scallopine or the Pork Scallopine I have always had in an Italian Restaurant, and how I prepare it at home,  has been made with the tenderloin of pork which is pounded very thin to create a tender, melt in your mouth feel from the pork.  If there are going to serve you a somewhat pounded pork chop, there need to describe it as such.  I asked the owner's wife what cut of pork they used and she told me it was not a pork chop and the server asked the kitchen and she told me it was a pork chop???\n\nI had to give them 2 stars for the service we received and the fact that they exchanged my meal for something else.  The replacement was the Lamb Lollipops which were overcooked and strangely served with waffle fries.  They seem to be a bit confused about what they are serving as Italian food--  waffle fries did not seem to compliment the lamb at all.\n\nI was so hopeful when we found out another Italian Restaurant opened in town since we seem to lack in number in Italian Restaurants compared to the other ethnic ones we have here in Tucson.\n\nI am sorry to say we will not be returning for another disappointing dinner here.","name":"Perche\u00e2\u0080\u0099 No Italian Bistro","address":"46 W Congress St","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85701","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":29,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","HappyHour":"True","Music":"{u'dj': None, u'live': False, u'jukebox': None, u'video': False, u'background_music': False, u'karaoke': None, u'no_music': False}","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"None","BestNights":"{u'monday': False, u'tuesday': False, u'wednesday': False, u'thursday': False, u'friday': False, u'saturday': False, u'sunday': False}","RestaurantsTableService":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': None, u'street': None, u'lot': False, u'validated': None}","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': None, u'casual': True, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': None, u'intimate': True, u'romantic': True, u'classy': None, u'upscale': None}","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'"},"categories":"Bars, Food, Gluten-Free, Coffee & Tea, Nightlife, Wine Bars, Restaurants, Italian"},{"review_id":"5Xhw_8Hjh1avJDkpMISjHQ","business_id":"vNLLqMsUUb08N7wFFK7AYw","stars_x":1.0,"date":1641083745000,"text":"We went there for lunch and I am not impressed.

I noticed this place recently opened in the middle of August when I saw a review of it on TucsonFoodie.com.  Being the only way you can get true Paleo in Tucson is if you graze your backyard for food or you go to a local hamburger joint and ask to remove the bun and all condiments, I was excited when the review said it was a Paleo establishment with a chef who knows his way around a kitchen (he's worked at some highly regarded kitchens in Tucson and from the state they just moved from).  So enough about the background, I thought, I wanna know about the food.\n\nThe Hidden Grill2go has an amazing food selection on its menu and the menu changes weekly.  I have tried Sun Basket meal prep (which is yummy btw) and a local lady who makes paleo meals in town and drop them off at a gym for pick up and The Hidden Grill beats them both.  Hidden Grill is slightly cheaper than Sun Basket (about $10-12 cheaper) but just as yummy and the food is prepared for you already.  It's Just Food, another paleo option, was okay (great concept however), not very nutritious, nice portions of meat but I had quit after a week (and I think they are no longer in business).\n\nThe food at The Hidden Grill could be described as gourmet for the average paleo joe.  It's not the gourmet you turn your nose up at in fear of eating.\n\nIn a 7 day period I have visited the place 3-4 times.  I even live about 20 minutes away and take the trek each time\nbecause the food is worth it.  It's not salty or sugary.  It incorporates a lot of different vegetables.  There's a lot of thought behind the selections.\n\nOn the menu you will find between 3-5 main dishes.  This past week's menu had:\n\nBlackened white fish\nGrilled Arizona Angus Beef Burger\nGrilled Boneless Pork Chop\nGrilled Chicken or Pan Fried Tofu in a Coconut Buffalo Sauce\nSalads:\nTuna Dip & Grilled Veggies\nCurry chicken salad\nChipotle grilled chicken & Bacon Salad\n\nI had the Blackened White Fish 2x, Tuna Dip and veggies, Angus Burger, Chipotle Grilled chicken salad, and Pan Fried Tofu in coconut buffalo sauce.  Each dish had its own distinctive flavor.  The white fish was more mild but had a great garnish of okra, onion, tomato, bell pepper, collard greens and corn (this was considered their gf,df non-paleo dish).  The Angus Burger I bought into lunch the next day at work.  It came with 3 patties of omg deliciousness!!!  You could easily taste the carmelized onions and the rosemary mushrooms.... it was one of the best hamburgers I've had (it's up there with the likes of Monkey Burger, and way definitely better than Graze).  My coworkers passed me by as I sat eating in a slight coma. The winner for me, surprisingly so was the Tuna Dip (Tunnato) with grilled veggies because I've never had Tunnato before and that was surprisingly yummy.  I haven't tasted the Pan Fried Tofu yet but even the dishes I didn't describe in detail that I had were all still very great. There wasn't an item\nI regretted purchasing.\n\nEach dish is about $12-13 with the exception of the salads.  You can buy extra servings of protein or sides for between $5-7.\n\nWhen you get to know how good the food tastes you will want to order some of their other options like 6 meals for $62 or 10 meals for $102. Each meal is prepared fresh.  \n\nBtw have you ordered a meal, take the rest home and reheat it the next day just to find it tasted nothing like the day before, but worse?  I've actually had all his meals taste even better the next day.  Sometimes I just wait the next day before eating because the seasoning just gets more exquisite to the mouth.  He also packs the meals in sturdy brown bags that are recyclable.\n\nI can't say enough about this place.  The only downside it's mostly intended for takeout.  There are a few tables and chairs to eat if you really want to eat in.  It's also a place where if your friends are tired of going to your other gluten free restaurants that are tasty to the taste bud of someone who hasn't had gluten in a long time, but really it's not like eating real food.  They will be really happy if you take them to, or bring home, some real food from The Hidden Grill.\n\nDefinitely one of the best tasting dedicated gluten free establishments in town (sorry Gourmet Girls- but you still have your breakfast\/brunch menu to keep you afloat).","name":"The Hidden Grill2go","address":"4955 N Sabino Canyon Rd, Ste 113","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85750","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":42,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","OutdoorSeating":"False"},"categories":"Restaurants, Health Markets, Specialty Food, Food Delivery Services, Food, Salad, American (New), Gluten-Free, Soup"},{"review_id":"evjzq-wmILN0ojR5tdGh-A","business_id":"n9kqlp48MzXB--LKoRjQhA","stars_x":5.0,"date":1535257041000,"text":"Well, my husband and I have our office across the street from this place, which just opened.

Einstein's has great egg sandwiches and coffee. I usually order whatever seasonal egg sandwich looks good, or I'll get a chorizo sunrise or a bacon, egg, and cheese. I occasionally get a latte but will stick with the drip coffee most of the time, because it's pretty solid, and they have a couple varieties.\n\nThis location can get busy, but they usually usher people through pretty quick. They seem to run out of a lot of types of bagels. I don't think I've ever been in and seen every bagel stocked up. My boyfriend likes the farmhouse sandwich, and they almost never have the hash brown bagel it comes on. I love pumpernickel, and they rarely run out of it, thankfully. \n\nEinstein's has a new rewards system. If you sign up with your email, they will send you a lot of coupons. You can now access the coupons with your phone number instead of using email. The staff are friendly, but they need some more training on the rewards system. They seem a little clueless about it. Most of the time, I'm in and out quick with my order, but they seem to move exceptionally slowly when it's not terribly busy. On my most recent visit it was very slow, and I saw a young lady make my sandwiches and leave them sitting for several minutes. She asked three other staff members to wrap them up and bag them, but I guess everyone was too busy. She went on making other customers' food and left mine sitting there, so people who came in after me had their food before I did.\n\nI do think the price point is maybe a bit high, but it's on par with similar-concept establishments. I often use their BOGO coupons, so it's quite affordable that way!\n\nI wish Einstein's would open a location somewhere on the east side. This is the closest one to my house and it's about 10-15 minutes out of my way.","name":"Einstein Bros.

The steak had a nice peppery flavor, as advertised. The accompanying veggies were also nicely seasoned. The Cajun wings were not spicy hot but still had plenty of flavor. The salad was a good mixture of greens and sunflower seeds. The dressing was nice.\n\nThe service was fast. My order was ready for pickup within 30 minutes.\n\nThere were however a couple of things that disappointed. For example the steak dish was very generous when it came to the inexpensive ingredients (potatoes, cabbage) but much less so (dare I say stingy) with the more expensive ingredient (beef). Perhaps this should be expected, but I'm mentioning it because I definitely noticed.\n\nThe jumbo chicken wings were not all that jumbo. The order comes with 10 wings. Five of them were good-sized (jumbo) drumettes, the other 5 were the smaller flats. Nothing wrong with flats but if they comprise half the order then marketing the dish as \"jumbo\" is at best misleading and at worst false advertising.\n\nLastly, I ordered take out and was put off a bit when I went to pick up my order. When checking out I was presented with automated tip choices starting at 18% and going up from there. It's a bit frustrating being expected to tip at that level for take out service. What exactly are we tipping when doing take out? To their credit there is an \"other\" choice where you can choose your tip amount but at the end of the day should there even be an expectation of tipping for take out?

I also got to try the PLG (passion, lemon, guava) and it was AMAZING. Just the right amount of sour and sweet - and definitely not too sweet at all! I am very picky about my drinks being too sweet so this was a delightful surprise. I'm also very much in the autumn mood so I of course had to get their pumpkin spice cold brew. And shockingly the cold brew was just as good as the lemonade!! I liked that even though it was a flavored coffee you could still get it unsweetened, which is so rare; so many pumpkin drinks are insanely sweet for no reason. I also ate their seasonal flatbread sandwich, and it was yummy and refreshing. This is definitely the perfect place for a refreshing beverage or a light lunch.

The chicken corn chowder was decent although again not a lot of chicken.

Their menu is fairly small, but there are still lots of options to find something that will satisfy. I went to the grand opening and was not surprised to see two long lines snaking around their fairly small parking lot. I was impressed with how organized they were in dealing with all those cars and people though. The deal that day was to buy a breakfast burrito of your choice for $2.99 and get one of their salads for free. I accidentally ordered the Fiesta burrito, instead of the southwest one is intended to order. For my free salad I chose the Cobb with chicken and blue cheese dressing. When they handed me my bag, it was quite heavy for only two items! I knew then that the portions were generous. The burrito was stuffed with delicious fillings. When I took a bite is when I discovered I'd ordered the wrong burrito. This one had quite a few potatoes in it and I was planning one without potatoes. Still, it was delicious and came with a packet of their salsa, which was a nice addition to the burrito. It was so big that I was able to get both breakfast and lunch from it! My husband and I split the Cobb salad for supper (he also had a leftover piece of chicken to fill him up). It was full of fresh greens and the toppings were placed in piles around on top--chicken, green onions, avocado, egg, with bacon and blue cheese crumbles scattered over the top of everything. The dressing was a bit more vinegary tasting than I prefer in blue cheese dressing, but my husband liked it. It was plenty of food for our meal. Overall, this looks like a good value for the dollar. It was fast, fresh, and delicious.

The bartender proceeded to help the people that walked in after me. All I needed was to be rung up for one beer and she just kept talking to this couple. Horrible service.\n\nDefinitely won't be back or recommending this place to anyone.

LOL  Was I at a dance club or or a restaurant?  My boyfriend and I went on a lunch date (together).  He ordered the Elote Pizza, and I went for the Italian Sandwich and Garlic Parmesan Fries.  We both ordered a drink.  I'm only giving them one star because the Elote Pizza was great.  The overall experience was TERRIBLE.\n\nAsked the server if hot or cold was better, she said HOT.  He got his Elote Pizza first, 5 minutes later we got our Parmesan Fries, and about 5 min after that I got my sandwich.  We arrived together, but ate separately.\n\nWhen I got my sandwich it was COLD.  I confirmed with the cashier that I ordered my sandwich hot, and she said yes you did.  After a discussion with the cook, she explained they did cook it but the veggies made the sandwich cold.  The cheese was not melted so I was confused.  She was going to talk to the mgr about it, but by this time I was starving and simply said it's fine.  It was not fine!!   I took one bite and I was upset.  I had waited so long and it was just a runny, soggy, mess.  I scraped all the toppings off and tried to eat it but it was too late.  The cashier and the cook offered ZERO solutions.  The both saw how absolutely hangry I was at this point and didn't even bother asking a manager to talk with me about it.  No offer to remake it, reheat it, NOTHING.  For just over $50 bucks with a tip, this is unacceptable.  \n\nLove Miller brothers brand, however there is simply something about the overall customer experience that is lacking at all locations with the exception of Serial Grillers on River.","name":"Transplant Detroit Style Pizza","address":"4603 E Speedway Blvd","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85712","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":44,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"HasTV":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"False","OutdoorSeating":"True","Alcohol":"u'beer_and_wine'","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': None, u'lot': True, u'validated': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","RestaurantsReservations":"False","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': None, u'casual': None, u'touristy': None, u'trendy': True, u'intimate': False, u'romantic': None, u'classy': True, u'upscale': False}","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True"},"categories":"Pizza, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"FT3uxOMcHpX6SpOhS_13LA","business_id":"kcz1aULlfllI85LwjtiSSw","stars_x":4.0,"date":1633415718000,"text":"Today was my first visit and it was amazing!

I love salads, but ordering them for takeout can be pretty pricey. Salad and Go is super affordable and has so many amazing options! \nMy boyfriend and I went for the grand opening special. I got the Southwest breakfast burrito with egg, turkey sausage, pepper jack cheese, and roasted poblano peppers, and he got the Fiesta burrito with egg, turkey sausage, potatoes, pepper jack cheese, and tortilla strips. We both thought they were tasty, filling, and a great deal for $2.99. The salsa comes in a packet on the side. It's quite tasty with a mild-to-medium spice level. My only complaint is I needed more of that delicious salsa! I'll definitely order an extra packet next time.\nFor our salads, I ordered the jalape\u00c3\u00b1o ranch with chicken, and he got the Cobb with chicken. It was hard to choose--there were several others that sounded amazing. I meant to ask for Buffalo chicken with my salad but totally forgot. I appreciate that they have that as an option as well as tofu and shrimp (for an up-charge). \nThe salads are a good size for a filling lunch. The ingredients tasted fresh, and the dressing was pretty flavorful. I just wish it had more of a jalape\u00c3\u00b1o kick! I also wish the salad had pickled jalape\u00c3\u00b1os in it, too, but the pickled red onions gave it a nice zing. \nThe salads are also reasonably priced at less than $6. Most local fast-casual salad options with this many toppings are $9+, so I really appreciate having Salad and Go come to Tucson. \nWe also saw the $1 cold brew on the menu and needed no convincing to grab a couple of those!

The dough was over-worked, DSP should be airy, crunchy and not too chewy. The sauce which some complained on other reviews as being \"too sweet\" is actually fairly on point. It's San marzano tomato sauce and that's exactly what those tomatoes are - perfectly acidic and sweet. \n\nIf you need an awesome Detroit Style Pizza recipe check out Kenji L\u00c3\u00b3pez-Alt from seriouseats it's checks all the boxes. \n\nWon't return.","name":"Transplant Detroit Style Pizza","address":"4603 E Speedway Blvd","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85712","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":44,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"HasTV":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"False","OutdoorSeating":"True","Alcohol":"u'beer_and_wine'","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': None, u'lot': True, u'validated': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","RestaurantsReservations":"False","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': None, u'casual': None, u'touristy': None, u'trendy': True, u'intimate': False, u'romantic': None, u'classy': True, u'upscale': False}","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True"},"categories":"Pizza, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"EfPD62gU8eUj6L8-NwUQvQ","business_id":"kxvW5Mfebywb0L1HTHdX3g","stars_x":5.0,"date":1637093080000,"text":"Incredible food and service, and such a cute location!!!!

It was wrapped in aluminum foil so I really didn't need the plastic bag at all.  I give them credit for not using styrofoam.  Thank you!  Now I'm torn between returning and asking for no bag, or not patronizing the place at all because they are not using paper bags.

I had the Southwest for which the description is \"Eggs, Housemade Turkey Sausage, Pepper Jack Cheese, Roasted Poblano Peppers, with Housemade Salsa on the side\".\n\nThe portion in the bowl was definitely much smaller than a breakfast burrito at any other place I've ever eaten at.  I'm not complaining at all....the portion fit the price, and it was definitely enough for me.  I'm sort of curious though as at least one other review here calls out the amounts of food as being enough for two people, so I was just surprised at the small portion.\n\nI was also surprised that the roasted poblano peppers which were right on top of the sausage and eggs were cold....like from the refrigerator cold.  Surely that's not how they are supposed to be?  I picked them off and warmed them, then added them back in.  Sadly, I had no salsa in my bag, and no salsa at home to add.  Perhaps the refrigerated peppers and missing salsa are just 'blip' and due to new employees.  It wasn't the end of the world, just hope next time it's better.\n\nThe taste of the burrito was perfectly spicy and something I'd definitely order again if the peppers are hot.  So, 4-stars for really friendly and fast service and good food.  I'm hoping to give them 5-stars on my next visit for great food.\n\nThat said, not included in this review is the parking lot situation.  I pulled in from Speedway, and then exited onto Speedway.  I waited  F O R E V E R  until some kind soul in traffic on Speedway had mercy on me and stopped to let me exit.  I needed to go south on Craycroft, and there was no way to get into the turn lane to head south because of traffic.  I had to just head west on Speedway, eventually get over into a turn lane, and make a U-turn to head back to Craycroft.  It just makes me wonder about the positioning of the building and the design of the parking lot.  I'll take a closer look the next time I'm there.  Maybe there's an easier way to exit that I just didn't see because I was not really focused or looking at all the possible exits.  But.....typically exits just a few car lengths away from a traffic light are not a good idea, and with an intersection as busy as Speedway\/Craycroft is, it seems illogical to have an exit there.","name":"Salad and Go","address":"5501 E Speedway Blvd","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85712","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":45,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BusinessAcceptsBitcoin":"False","WiFi":"u'no'","Alcohol":"u'none'","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': False, u'lot': True, u'validated': False}","WheelchairAccessible":"True","Caters":"False","HasTV":"False","DriveThru":"True","DogsAllowed":"True","OutdoorSeating":"None","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"None","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"None","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","RestaurantsTableService":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"False"},"categories":"Salad, Restaurants, Vegetarian, Breakfast & Brunch, Vegan, Fast Food"},{"review_id":"cPUp41A6q14JvUptNiUXyg","business_id":"HxsFX1tOzgZ2edWCTCSycQ","stars_x":5.0,"date":1638119806000,"text":"Delicious, authentic Greek food in a friendly little place!

Seriously $20 for what really is a $10 personal pan pizza. Okay enough about me paying $20 for 4 tiny slices. The ingredients were finely chopped they most certainly came from a bag right out of the food supply company van which is why they need to charge $5 for a slice. I was going to get the cheese pizza and noticed it was $4 to add pepperoni, so I assumed this must be a huge pizza because of the cost. I should've read the description better and realized they were trying to charge $20 for a personal pan pizza. Let's not forget they wanted to charge 50 cents per slice of pepperoni.

Each platter was $9.99.\n\nThe waiting line to order at 12:00 was fairly long and took about 12 minutes to get to the counter as there were only two registers open - at lunch time. We ordered, sat and waited. It took about 18 to 20 minutes to get our order.\n\nWhen we received our order... I was surprised. The food sure didn't look like what comes on the photograph in the weekly mailing ad we get. None of the coupons are valid for the platter either. Two small pieces of fried cod... both burnt. Twelve crinkle cuts fries, a small dinner bun and three tablespoons coleslaw. We also had a side of tarter sauce and butter. There wasn't much to the meal and the cod was really over cooked. \n\nOn a side note, the restaurant was reasonably clean. When we went into the restaurant, I was holding the door for my friend. Out of the blue comes a Culver's employee who hussled inside, while I held the door, without glancing at me, saying thank you or even acknowledging a paying client was holding the door for her.

I went to Culver on 04\/30\/2017 for some ice cream shakes and malts at 9:50ish pm. My cashier for the evening drive thru is Nathalie, and so far she has been rude and stubborn when I corrected her. I ordered an Oreo\/Caramel shake and a mint Oreo\/brownie shake. I was surprised I only got spoons and not a straw. Also my shakes was already partially melted, and the cup was not full. I was appalled by this, but refrained from saying something, and I gave her a salutation. Also she did not give me my receipt the first time around When my girlfriend and I left Culver's. Not even two minutes later she tried the brownie and notice how stale it was. I rushed back to Culver's and demanded a receipt. One of the employees gave me a receipt kindly. After that I asked them to return my drinks since it was bad quality. The employee Nathalie was giving me snide and rude remarks because supposedly my drink can not be return because it was already melted and looks like it was half full when it was not even filled up all the way when I purchased the shakes.  She even have the audacity to said she ate some brownies a few min ago and said it was still good quality. After my girlfriend told her that the transaction was recorded thru the company security cam. All of a sudden she gave me my full refund, but Miss I can't count using basic math didn't give me my money back correctly. After I gave her some basic math training because the company can't afford it. I finally got all of my money back. I am never going back here again. Because I never heard of partial refund before from a fast food or any industry. Culver's make my day with that dumb remark. They should properly train there employees on how to count, and if they need more special training they should use there fingers to add or subtract numbers. This is a true story, and I'm never coming back here again thanks to bad costumer service like Nathalie.","name":"Culver's","address":"3070 S Campbell Ave","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85713","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":45,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","DriveThru":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","HasTV":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsReservations":"False","GoodForKids":"True","NoiseLevel":"'average'","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","BikeParking":"True","WiFi":"'free'","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': True}","Alcohol":"'none'","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","OutdoorSeating":"True","Caters":"False","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","ByAppointmentOnly":"False","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': None, u'lot': True, u'validated': False}","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"True"},"categories":"Restaurants, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Burgers, Salad, Fish & Chips, Fast Food, Food"},{"review_id":"n-XTHJazASJCb0Y7LV3b_Q","business_id":"9r-sVEHe8BQn518XgJvzPA","stars_x":5.0,"date":1445985781000,"text":"This place is great!

It is clean and refreshed from its previous incarnation, sporting multiple TVs with different games on each.\n\nService was great. Our waitress was infinitely patient and returned to our table several times when we had trouble stopping our chatter to peruse the menu. Although the beer and specialty drinks menu is extensive, we settled on ordinary drinks - except for the peach vodka - and chose the house-made potato chips for munching. They were seasoned and quite yummy but would have been elevated by a house-made dip of some kind. At this point I would have awarded four stars. \n\nSince we didn't really eat, I decided to take an order of their wings home for the hub and me for dinner. The wings are proudly billed as smoked, never fried, in a choice of plain or a variety of heat levels.\n\nWhat we had was $15 of inedible chicken wings. They were chewy and stringy and too smoky. Smoked meats should be very tender, and, although the smokiness was certainly evident, these wings probably needed additional cooking time. We actually threw away the rest of them and now I worry that the smoking process created the appealing color and that the chicken was underdone. Final award is two stars, balancing the in-house and takeout experiences.","name":"Firetruck Brewing Company ","address":"9155 E Tanque Verde Rd, Ste 177","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85749","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":48,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"OutdoorSeating":"True","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","Music":"{'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': False, 'live': True, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}","HappyHour":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': None, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}"},"categories":"Nightlife, Breweries, American (Traditional), Bars, Restaurants, Food"},{"review_id":"lk5mvOJxivxhZ9KnzOrbXQ","business_id":"ZGCbGANEWt187yUBSJWLyg","stars_x":5.0,"date":1552090750000,"text":"Have y'all heard of \"Cr\u00c3\u00a8me de la cr\u00c3\u00a8me\" on customer service astonishing on how great I was greated at the drive thru window.

I paused and though wow I'm out of here just at he moment one turned and asked if she could help me. What I novel idea. I hesitated as I still thought it best to leave based on the juju. I didn't. She cooked my burger to leather. Payback I guess for disrupting such a peacefully time. I got the grilled onions, cold with no clear idea of how old. Still flavorful but weird.

So after 5-6 hours of hiking we were headed back into Tucson and looking for a place to grab a burger and beer. As we left the mountains, we remembered that the waiter at the East Grant Road Sentinel Peak brew pub, said they opened another location on the east side. As it happened we were passing the Tanque Verde Road pub on the way back to the hotel. So based on our experience at the other location and the fact they had a slightly different menu, we stopped. The first thing we noticed was that it was getting busy and it appeared that there was only one person working and she was flying all over trying to cover everything. Based on her flying solo, she did a great job getting us a drink and taking\/delivering our order (all while smiling!). We each had an Icebreaker IPA, which was good. For food we got an order of fried pickles and each had a burger. We asked that the pickles come first which they did, and then shortly after the burgers followed. Each were cooked just as we requested and they were good size. For a side my wife got the smoked beans, which were something we never had, and I got house made chips. We split the sides and both agreed the house chips were excellent, the smoked beans you probably have to acquire a taste for, but they were interesting. The fried pickles were excellent. Overall the food was above average, the beer is pretty much average (better than drinking commercial beer) and the atmosphere was ok. The Tanque Verde place used to be another bar and it looks like Sentinel Peak just moved in, made no improvements and started doing business. The credit card charge even has the old place name on it (your actual bank transaction that is). It would be good to see Sentinel make a few upgrades to make the new location their own. If in the area, we would probably go back based on the food. If this was not a brew pub, the food would make it a 4 star, but the beer for us is an integral part of the equation and the beer here is just average.","name":"Firetruck Brewing Company ","address":"9155 E Tanque Verde Rd, Ste 177","city":"Tucson","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85749","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":48,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"OutdoorSeating":"True","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","Music":"{'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': False, 'live': True, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}","HappyHour":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': None, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}"},"categories":"Nightlife, Breweries, American (Traditional), Bars, Restaurants, Food"},{"review_id":"qjKEdFeBMq-mWA5GWyv3Kw","business_id":"ECUu-31E44hl7irKMx79Hg","stars_x":5.0,"date":1552155280000,"text":"GREAT addition to Tanque Verde!!!!

We came about 3pm and the lunch crowd had left.  The concept was new for me and the young lady at the register was very helpful.  Interesting concept to have the burger on a bun or in a bowl over greens.  Great toppings! There were two other employees working: a male 20 something with his hat on backward and a dark haired tall girl.  At the initial few minutes, no problem. When I was starting to build, the young lady had issues understanding which burger was to get which topping which resulted in some toppings being put on and then off.\n\nFinally got the burgers and fries, which were excellent.  The fried onions, mushrooms and bacon appeared to be on a hot plate so one would assume that they would be at least warm when placed on the burger.  Wrong, the onions were stone cold as was the bacon, although flavorful.\n\nThe issue came as we were eating. Everything is packed in a to go bag, even if you are eating it there in the very limited seating.  As we were enjoying our meal, albeit messy because of the toppings, another customer came up and asked some questions about bun vs bowl. This time the young man was at the register.  His comment was \"I don't eat here, so I don't know.\"  The customer, as I did, thought he was joking.  He wasn't! When she questioned him further, his comment was \"I wouldn't eat here\" and with that she walked away and purchased her food elsewhere.\n\nNow the three of them are yucking it up behind the counter and he starts dropping the F-bomb is discussing another person who had gone to job interview.  This was loud enough for the four customers who were in the immediate area to hear clearly.\n\nObviously, or maybe not, there was not a supervisor on duty.

The food we've had, I am sad to say, mostly misses the mark.\n\nThere are, however, some highlights:\nThe chips and housemade ranch had our table swooning.\n\nWhat missed the mark:\nThe \"shredded beef\" on the nachos was not your typical Tucson iteration of shredded beef, but more like smoked tri-tip that was shredded. The smoky flavor threw me off and I didn't particularly care for it.\n\nI have had the Reuben at the original location and bragged about it, so I went with a buddy and we split the Reuben and Cubano to try both. I was actually surprised that we were fairly disappointed in both.\n\nI will go on to say that, in my review of the original location, I opined that a burger on the menu would be nice. The \"Backdraft\" burger, with  fresh jalape\u00c3\u00b1os and chipotle mayo will have you reaching for whatever beverage you have at hand. So there's that... I'd probably stick to a burger here. Maybe I'm just not a BBQ fan.\n\nThey have all their signature beers on tap and a full bar with decent happy hour specials. Every time I have been they have been busy, so they seem to have a following and the reviews are positive.

We arrived around 6 and it was nearly full inside. Our waitress came to ask about drinks and we started with an array of samplers to try their different brews. It was still happy hour so we decided to order a chicken and green chili quesadilla and BBQ pulled pork sliders. The beers were good and the food was served fairly quickly. We also decided to order a couple of full-size beers to wash down our appetizers. The appetizers looked delicious. The quesadilla was huge and full of chicken and green chilies. It was mouth-watering with a little salsa. The slider looked delicious also. A grilled bun with pork topped with coleslaw. They tasted alright, sadly the coleslaw had made the sides and bottoms of the buns soggy to the point it was just unappetizing to eat. After we finished our appetizers we wanted to order dinner. We ordered a pulled pork sandwich that was described as in a roll with BBQ sauce, coleslaw, provolone and jalape\u00c3\u00b1os. By the time we ordered this the restaurant had gotten very busy and our waitress was getting difficult to track down. Our food finally came, brought by another restaurant employee. The sandwich was truly disappointing. The roll was maybe a 6\" sub roll cut in half. Each side cut maybe halfway with a bit of pork stuff in, a couple drops of BBQ sauce and some cheese, coleslaw and diced jalape\u00c3\u00b1os thrown on top. I'm not sure what exactly in the dish is watery, or if the food just say awhile, but like the sliders the bread was all wet. This however was wet on the entire bottom side of the sandwich, and only half of it was fit for eating. I ended up slicing it the rest of the length and spreading out the ingredients. The BBQ sauce was so scarce and this helping of the pulled pork filled with fatty chunks, there was hardly any flavor of true polled pork. The jalape\u00c3\u00b1os took me aback too. Although the description said nothing special about the jalape\u00c3\u00b1os, I was hoping they would be grilled and sitting in with the BBQ sauce and pork for an awesome flavor pop. Sadly they weren't. The sandwich definitely fell short. The service was disappointing as well. Our waitress seemed completely disinterested in us except for the orders we were placing. After our food was delivered, she never returned to check on how it was, and after the first round of drinks and food, we had to get her attention each time we needed something. Besides our waitress and the less-than-appetizing sandwiches, the beer was good, the quesadilla and fries yummy, and the atmosphere fun and lively. We still enjoyed the evening and for the price, it's not a bad little spot for a quick beer and appetizer on the east side.

He also explained that the menu on line did not pertain to all stores and that was where there was a lot of confusion and they were going to work on having a separate menu for Arizona on line. I went in a couple of days later, night and day. Awesome service, people there who knew exactly what to do, speedy and a sandwich that cannot be beat!!!!! (The gentleman I spoke to offered to send me a coupon but I guess he forgot because I never did get it.) My family and I eat there on average once a week now.","name":"Jersey Mike's Subs","address":"18690 S Nogales Hwy, Ste 124","city":"Green Valley","state":"AZ","postal_code":"85614","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":31,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}","DriveThru":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","DogsAllowed":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Alcohol":"u'none'","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","HasTV":"True","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': None, u'lot': None, u'validated': None}"},"categories":"Fast Food, Sandwiches, Delis, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"fOIWDy_Ygtep2sgCEILtNA","business_id":"ZGCbGANEWt187yUBSJWLyg","stars_x":5.0,"date":1616559935000,"text":"I love getting the green chilli burger with onion rings and coke.

He told us it would be a 20-30 min wait... didn't take our names or anything and made us go back down to the hotel lobby to wait. While we waited we saw plenty of people take the elevator. When we went back up we saw two parties (who we saw enter the hotel while we waited) there and got seated before us. All the while, not getting acknowledged by the security guard. He let the second party in and finally said... y'all are next just give me a few more minutes. Meanwhile more people came up. And no one got sent back down to the lobby like we did. It was honestly humiliating. We got sat, ordered one drink, took a few pictures because the sunset and views were absolutely beautiful... chugged our one drink, paid and left.

Odd, despite the sparse crowd it took quite a while for the food to come out. And when my brisket sandwich arrived, it was 'shredded' meat with slices of onions thrown in. It was so shredded, I thought I had been served a pulled pork dish by mistake. No, the server assured me, this was the 'BBQ brisket' sandwich. Again when the check came, I asked if the brisket was always 'shredded' and was told yes. I mentioned I had the brisket not more than three weeks prior and it was sliced.

We drank some wine and chatted with fellow patrons and the bartender who were friendly and full of good conversation. Taylor (the bartender) was extremely knowledgeable of her drinks and enjoyed making drinks for everyone. Her work ethic and dedication to her craft was amazing. I had some wine and then Taylor made me a tequila old fashioned....This was amazing and strong but had a great flavor balance. Coming off from a VIP tequila experience at Epcot I am not the easiest to please when it comes to tequila based drinks but Taylor would of made the mouse proud. Unfortunately, the POS system had broke down during our visit but both Taylor and the manager on staff handled the situation with as much grace as they could muster.

We requested to be seated outside when a table opened and we were told we were at the top of the list. Immediately, we ordered drinks, queso\/chips, and our meals. Over the next hour, our drinks were delicious but everything else was a complete disaster. We watched many tables leave from outside and new groups go outside. Despite reminding the host and waitress kindly, they avoided us and when confronted they reassured us without following through. Our queso took an hour and 10 minutes to arrive at which point the queso was oily, crispy on the side, and impenetrable to reach; our chips crumbling trying to reach what we thought would be soft queso but was thickened strips of cheese. Kindly, we asked for a new order of queso because we were unable to enjoy the one before us. At this point, we were frustrated. After waiting for so long we had no food and were not being moved outside. I talked to the host, she told me they had a clear table she was about to bring us outside. 15 minutes went by and still no new queso, no outdoor table, and our food (2 paninis and a quesadilla) was probably an hour+ from arriving. I decided to get the check, which again took 10+ minutes until I approached the host where she had charged us for 2 Quesos. After the fix, I immediately paid. We talked with the manager who was extremely unprofessional. As someone who has worked in the industry, I understand things can become busy but communication is key. Rather than explaining or giving some clarification to the chaos or even apologizing, he became defensive and blamed the rush (that was no longer there after 2+ hours). When expressing frustration with the cost and experience not aligning he was shocked yet offered no kind resolution or peace offering of any sort.  \n\n\nI felt extremely bad for the staff. Clearly, there is a larger issue at hand on a business level. Others around us felt similar, many walking out and others closing their checks early and verbally expressing a lack of tip. The bartender and our waitress were kind and working hard for everyone. The host and manager were extremely unprofessional and lacked communication completely.
