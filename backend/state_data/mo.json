If you don't look closely, you are sure to pass it up because it is tucked away in a quiet neighborhood.\n\nAtmosphere: This was one of my favorite things that I noticed about the coffee shop. It is full of warm, positive messages from patrons as well as positive slogans hanging on the walls. A nice selection of couches and artsy tables to choose from. It felt like walking into a home which made the environment wonderful to work in. I felt a sense of calmness while sitting down which was something I hadn't felt in a long time when getting to work.\n\nCoffee - I have a tendency to just get my go-to favorite of a caramel latte with extra caramel, but I decided to go with the special which was the Honey Vanilla Lavender. You could taste each flavor individually which I appreciated it and the lavender wasn't overpowering.\n\nA bonus: It came in an adorable mug that you would find in your kitchen which made the experience homier. I love it when coffee shops veer away from the basic clean cut cups of just solid colors\n\nService: Everyone was helpful and kind and assisted me with navigating through the menu. Patience is something I appreciate it when I arrive at a new place. It makes the experience all the better. Also, they have a point system that stays in house which makes me happy because I won't lose it as I have with other places lol\n\nOverall, I may have found my new place to work and write. The environment and the coffee is something to experience. If you are over near the macklind area, go over to Espresso Yourself.

And two, if I tried to make up an image of a neighborhood coffee shop in my head, this is what I'd come up with.\n\nThe vibe here, again, is friendly. There is seating inside and outside, and you'll often see someone who must've stopped by while walking their dog or going for a daily walk just chilling with a drink at an outside table.\n\nBased upon their great array of specialty lattes, I would say that their focus is more on the casual, not particularly pretentious coffee drinkers. Which to me is fine, since St Louis has plenty of the more pretentious coffee shops.\n\nThe only knock on this place is that because it is in a neighborhood, parking is limited and on the street. Usually if I stop by early, it's not an issue. But it is something to keep in mind.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend this place.

Upon walking in the woman behind the counter was UNBELIEVABLY rude. No smile, no hello, and a HORRIBLE attitude. I'm almost 40 years old, have lived all over the country, overseas, traveled the world, and can honestly say I've NEVER experienced such complete rudeness when trying to purchase something from someone. I grew up in this neighborhood, frequented this place prior to it being Bellos, and recently moved back with my husband and children. I was excited to come back in and have cookies made for my son's birthday, but couldn't even follow through with the order because I was so ASTONISHED by this woman's attitude. I do want to be clear that this woman had long black hair, piercings and tattoos (Though you can't always see them, I too have piercings and tattoos so let me be clear that this was NOT the issue). I'm clarifying because I would imagine that there are some very courteous and professional people employed at this establishment who are not deserving of this review. But you are only as strong as your weakest link, and I could not go in good conscious without posting something. To top it off, she actually took my phone out of my hand to take back to the kitchen after she told me she didn't know if they could make a Lego cookie. She said nothing else after saying she didn't know if they could make the cookie, lips harshly pursed while looking off to the side (yes, that is actually an accurate account)! So I asked if she could ask the bakers. ( I was already very offended at this point). She offered another rude expression, shook her head at me and grabbed MY phone without even asking me if she could take it for a minute, which I would have gladly allowed her to do. I'm absolutely blown away! She can't possibly be like this to everyone! To conclude here, upon leaving I said that I would not be purchasing the cookies, that she had been very rude and that she seemed to be a very unhappy person. She smiled the most smirky smile I will probably ever see in person until my kids are teenagers, and so I walked out. I felt nothing but sadness upon walking out of there and will not be coming back.

The sauce was so thick (supposedly Alfredo) yet, my son who got fettucini Alfredo was a much whiter sauce that was thin and much more appealing looking.  It seems my sauce was probably sitting in the heating table until it was almost gone, so it had cooked down way too much and they must have prepared a fresh one upon realizing there was not enough for the dishes, as it was also dry and no extra sauce on the bottom of the bowl to be found. \nMy daughter also did not eat and we left a whole plate of food. \nI got an email for signing up for their announcements to claim 6 piece toasted ravioli for free.

So we apologized to the staff waiting to take our order and went through the opening to the other side.  My friend who went with me last week got the same thing from the week prior...burrito and iced tea - she said it's the best tea in the city. The newbie followed her lead and got the burrito and a double espresso. He loved both.  I really wanted to try something different. I wanted this review to talk about something other than a breakfast burrito but I couldn't do it.  I did however get an iced Chai tea latte with a shot of espresso. \nA little backstory before I tell you how I really feel about this burrito and my beverage. There was this place on Hampton that I went to weekly for breakfast. He had the best breakfast burrito and homemade salsa in Saint Louis.  It was the perfect heat (even for me...I'm a wuss) and he served it with potatoes and it was a delightfully filling meal. Sadly, he isn't open anymore but I'll continue to rate any breakfast burrito against his. \nAll that being said this breakfast burrito is chock full of egg with the perfect amount of bacon. I'm guessing the bacon is chopped because there aren't any tough bites where you have to rip a piece of bacon in half. You know what I'm saying? The salsa isn't made in house but I was told it's made somewhere in town. So not some Old El Paso stuff.  It again looked like it wasn't enough food but it honestly was the right amount. As for my beverage... this is why it's a 4 for me (it would probably be a 5 for my pals but hey, I'm writing this) - last week I had the black tea and while I always put sweetener in it I had to put more cuz it was a little too bitter for me.  Not bitter as in old but bitter bitter.  (That should clear it up.  Haha) Yesterday's Chai tea latte with the shot of espresso was also bitter. I know what you are thinking but when I get this at other locations it's not bitter. The good thing about it is that I didn't slurp it all down real fast like I usually do I really took my time with it.  So it lasted through my breakfast. Which was nice because even though it was really warm out there was a great breeze on the outside patio. \nI'll let you know if I ever get to the sandwich shop. Not sure if that's gonna happen any time soon since I'm already thinking about that breakfast burrito.","name":"Espresso Yourself Coffee & Cafe","address":"5351 Devonshire Ave","city":"St. Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63109","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":46,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BusinessAcceptsBitcoin":"False","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","Alcohol":"u'none'","HappyHour":"False","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","GoodForKids":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","Corkage":"False","WheelchairAccessible":"True","WiFi":"u'free'","BYOB":"False","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"False","DogsAllowed":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","HasTV":"True"},"categories":"Caterers, Event Planning & Services, Restaurants, Food, Cafes, Coffee & Tea"},{"review_id":"PLmCC-IpZ4Dl8G31ykK3NQ","business_id":"ckNVsfVzpo9FJPO0Axrw3A","stars_x":4.0,"date":1640823179000,"text":"Decent value.

We walked around for the first hour and while waiting the final 45 minutes the hostess gave us a cookie out of pity, ha! Nice gesture, it just is what it is. Make a reservation if you can!\n\nUpon dining the wait didn't matter. The brunch was classical and hearty, but also unique. Portions were enough be to satisfied but also wanting to come back for more. \n\nDrinks included full coffee bar, traditional brunch drinks (fresh squeezed oj mimosas) as well as a variety of brunch themed cocktails. All delicious! \n\nWe had the eggs Benedict which was served on toast with prosciutto and a creamy hollandaise. The egg sandwich was perfectly cooked and balanced. The hash browns gave me upscale McDonald's vibes (which lets be honest has delicious hash browns).  \n\nService was prompt and once seated everything seemed to flow pretty good for it being prime time.","name":"Bowood by Niche","address":"4605 Olive St","city":"St. Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63108","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":22,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsTableService":"True","BYOB":"True","WheelchairAccessible":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"False","Caters":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","HasTV":"False","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","Corkage":"True","WiFi":"u'free'","OutdoorSeating":"False","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': None, u'street': True, u'lot': None, u'validated': None}"},"categories":"Restaurants, Food, Sandwiches, Desserts, Breakfast & Brunch"},{"review_id":"3exmHg3omDktaaKKs3pbnA","business_id":"mVR0Q82u4QlQLBQ0NU_izg","stars_x":5.0,"date":1596398970000,"text":"Great deli on St. Charles.

The $2.50 price makes ordering a few still one of the most affordable food choices compared to what other trucks offer.

After a few minutes the lady in the truck apologized for the wait that they were being made fresh.  It hadn't been but 4-5 minutes.  Order was ready, and I was met with another apology for the wait, and my order had 2 extra empanadas free to make up for it.   I've waited twice as long at other trucks for food, even been treated as though placing an order was burdensome.  But this, to the contrary was a very pleasant surprise.  These folks not only make great affordable food, but exhibit a level of customer service unmatched by any other food truck I've patronized.

One of my great aunt's 2 story house where she always had tea and homemade bread for you even if she didn't know you were coming.  Country music playing, tin ceiling, home baked items in a display case and a friendly greeting as you walked in the door. \nWe found this place by accident. We had gone to Soulard Market to get some plants and was just checking out the buildings around it and decided to stop in for breakfast. We were too early but one of the owners was loading up his truck with treats to sell at the market and said they would be opening in about 30 minutes. So we went for a walk. We got back just as they opened at 8am. So glad we waited. \nThis place was clean and so inviting. I ordered the Country Classic which is 2 eggs (I had mine scrambled and the only bad thing I can say about them is that there weren't enough...I don't know what they put in them but I assure you those were no ordinary scrambled eggs), sausage (homemade... and not with a strange sage flavor that leaves you tasting the sausage later on in the day), fried potatoes (there were a TON of these but I personally thought they were a little overcooked), then there was the biscuit (a REAL biscuit... not one of those round flaky things,  this solid biscuit was the size of a medium loaf of bread and so tasty). My friend got the same as me but she got grits. (She KNOWS grits and was thrilled with these. I am new to the \"grit scene\" and plain grits just don't do it for me but these? I could have eaten a bushel of these. \nOne of the owners said they used to have a farm in Maryland Heights but sold it yesterday (I believe). His wife was doing the cooking and he came around asking how everything was. \nIt's was such a fun environment that one couple that came in started talking to another couple and then I happily chimed in. I believe that when you are having good food in a relaxing environment it makes you feel like you are having breakfast (or whatever) with your family. Good times!! \nI'll definitely be going back soon.","name":"Mauki's Bakery & Country Store","address":"1730 S 8th St","city":"St Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63104","stars_y":5.0,"review_count":32,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"HasTV":"True","WiFi":"u'free'","Alcohol":"u'none'","Corkage":"False","DogsAllowed":"True","WheelchairAccessible":"False","Caters":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"True","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': None, u'street': True, u'lot': False, u'validated': None}","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","BYOB":"True"},"categories":"Food, Bakeries, Donuts, Breakfast & Brunch, Comfort Food, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"BGlbSTKchefq4u9eE4NunQ","business_id":"8iUZth_qBgz_GTgaIgyOaw","stars_x":5.0,"date":1629222920000,"text":"It was a busy day at Soulard Market so we had to park a few blocks away.

We decided to stop on the way back to the car when we were finished at the market. We passed Mauki's stall in the market and saw a wide selection of dessert breads that interested us. We headed to the store and were discussing getting breakfast or lunch somewhere as we entered. We were greeted immediately and asked if we were eating. The name doesn't include restaurant and I missed the small Sign outside advertising food. \nAfter looking at the pies, cookies, breads etc we looked at the menu and decided to dine here. Best decision I've made in a while. We sat down and the cheerful woman who greeted us introduced herself as Chrystal  and handed us menus. Breakfast and lunch choices both looked good. We started with Iced tea and an excellent iced coffee. Then ordered a half order of Biscuits N Gravy. (Warning! The half order is massive! ) and a Hearty Cluck sandwich \nThe food arrived in a reasonable amount of time, was visually appealing and tasted great. The biscuits are square cut sheet pan biscuits. The gravy has a generous amount of sausage and is well seasoned. The chicken fried steak is coated in crisp batter and super tender. Great southern cooking. \nThis place is a hidden gem.

During Covid, there's nothing like not having to pay a delivery fee and walking out your door to a food truck, Plus it's Cuban food! Could it be any better. Well my friends, it can. I've been to plenty of Cuban places that have not been up to snuff, but this is not one of them. I ordered the pork sandwich, the Cuban sandwich, two servings of tostones, and a couple of drinks (note: the sandwiches came with a side of fries). The people in the truck were so friendly, especially considering the circumstances that we're all living in right now. Plus, they threw in a beef empanada, which made my day, and was probably the best thing that I had to eat the entire day. Next time I am ordering one of each empanada!\n\nThe empanada was flaky crispy soft and filled with the most delicious seasoned beef I've ever had!\n\nThe Cuban sandwich was delicious the meat was so so flavorful and lean, I'm not sure if it's a preference,  but I personally like more pickle and mustard on my Cuban, but I had asked for extra and they gave me plenty so don't be afraid to ask for what you need. The pork sandwich was perfect, meat and cheese and bread! That is literally all my partner wanted and they had it.\n\nThe tostones (The Hispanic version of french fries) were good, probably not the best ones I've had, but mind you I'm Puerto Rican so nobody can make them better than my grandma. I think they were fried a little bit too long which made them a little bit tough.

Service is quick, the staff are personable (even when slammed under the morning rush) and the atmosphere is a little less corporate in feel. There's little mistaking that you're in a Starbucks when you step in the door, but it's also distinctly the Central West End Starbucks.\n\nSkim the reviews (or Google Maps) and you'll find just about all that you need to know for a great visit to this walkable store.\n\nThere's no dedicated parking lot or pickup spot, but there a few sturdier places to lock up a bike on the block. (Drivers do have options though. There's a public garage above the Schlafly Library on Euclid and metered parking along the street. Free street parking is often available to the east of the shop on Maryland Ave and there's a paid parking lot across the street too).\n\nThere's no drive-thru, but mobile orders are usually accepted. The location isn't that large, but does have a good mix of semi-communal seating, small tables, sidewalk seating and a couple of more comfortable chairs.\n\nIf there's really any complaint with the store, it's the minor irritation of its tendency to sell out of products, whether it's Blonde Roast, breakfast sandwiches or Nitro Cold Brew (each of which have been unavailable at least once during my random stops in over the past year). I've never had that affect an app order but, if you have your mind set on a particular item, it's probably best to order ahead.","name":"Starbucks","address":"4656 Maryland Ave","city":"St. Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63108","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":43,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"OutdoorSeating":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","WiFi":"u'free'","ByAppointmentOnly":"False","Caters":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True"},"categories":"Food, Restaurants, Coffee & Tea"},{"review_id":"F0fI4dzQtKxhpa1Zl3ylGA","business_id":"8iUZth_qBgz_GTgaIgyOaw","stars_x":5.0,"date":1632429914000,"text":"I love this home town cooking breakfast spot!\n\nEveryone that works here is so nice and they love their homemade hot sauce. \n\nAll of us went for the sweet side of breakfast and we weren't disappointed.

Ordered the cuban sandwich and was met with the seemingly ubiquitous, \"fries?\"  Knowing I'm in food truck land and upsells for sides can add $5-7 to my bill, I politely said no thanks.\n  I did ask for extra pickles on the sandwich and heard the lady at the window say mucho something which started a bit of an argument in the truck.  I going to guess the sandwiches are prepped ahead with little ability to alter.(Especially since mine seemed standard after recieving) Figuring my sandwich probably wouldnt be enough I also ordered 2 beef empanadas.\n\nOrder was prepared quickly, maybe 5 minutes.  When I opened my bag, it had fries.  Apparently, the sandwich comes with a side item and my worry of an upsell was only an assumption I wanted fries.    Now Im curious what other sides the have available.\n\nThis was all to-go btw.  When I got home sandwich (missing extra pickles) was larger than expected.  Too often food truck portions are on the small side.  This was easily good for 2 people.  Fries, nice unexpected bonus, and the beef empanadas were really, really good.

But let's talk about the Cane's sauce....I can't get away with not ordering extra which they will charge you for and I will happily pay. The tangy delicious sauce I use with both the chicken and the fries. The caniac meal with six chicken fingers, fries, and a 32oz drink is my husband and my go to meal to share when we're on the go.","name":"Raising Cane's Chicken Fingers","address":"2707 S Big Bend Blvd","city":"Maplewood","state":"MO","postal_code":"63143","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":28,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","BikeParking":"True","Alcohol":"u'none'","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","WiFi":"'no'","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}","RestaurantsTableService":"False","OutdoorSeating":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","HasTV":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsReservations":"False","DriveThru":"True","GoodForKids":"True","DogsAllowed":"False"},"categories":"Restaurants, Southern, Fast Food, Chicken Wings, Chicken Shop"},{"review_id":"Rm0pq1uCJLtEiziKmnhwig","business_id":"dLtvYS2OPDtzDp_YEgEB3w","stars_x":4.0,"date":1518032584000,"text":"Don't Forget To Kiss The Cook :\n\nI don't usually write reviews about fast food restaurants BUT when one of the employees go above and beyond ...it's time to let the boss know you have a Fantastic Employee...\nHer name is Amanda ...After finishing our meal we moved the empty baskets with our trash at the edge of the table , one of the girls working there walked by three times and never once asked ...

These were the 3 items we ordered since we had to drive back for 4 hrs we placed order for to go. \nI didn't checked the reviews as the name was familiar. But it was the opposite.  The Mirchi bajjis they were tasteless.  There was no salt, no spice at all.  They didn't even have the order with some sliced onions, lemon or chaat masala sprinkled.  The flour used didn't seemed besan but instead corn flour I guess.  They basically dipped the green peppers in plain flour without even salt and gave it to us. I was very disappointed.

Perfect service and large selection of authentic dishes. I was impressed by their extremely clean and tastefully decorated dining area, which is not common in most strip mall restaurants. First, the wonderful aromas of grilled meats, fresh herbs, and spices that hits you when you walk in is intoxicating! The second we walked in we were immediately welcomed by several employees in a warm fashion. I chose the Thai vegetable stir fry with beef and my companion chose the green curry with pork. I also got a papaya salad and Tom Kha soup(chicken, lemon grass, coconut milk) as those are my tester for the quality of Thai food. I have found a new favorite Thai spot!! A delicious Tom Kha arrived in a cute little crock, full to the brim with savory herbaceous broth. It was piping hot and heavy on the fish sauce, but mild on spice. I will ask for Thai spicy next time. [It had so many pieces of lemon grass and galangal(wonderful citrus flavor) in it though, which made it hard to eat. They are woody and pretty inedible and should be removed from the soup IMO before serving like bay leaves, cloves, etc. but I counted at least fifteen pieces in my small bowl. Just a small complaint, because the soup itself was excellent]\nPapaya salad: best I have had in MO. Came in a huge portion with tomatoes, fried cashews, and an amazing sweet, spicy, sour sauce with plenty of limes for squeezing! yay! Perfect.\n\nStir fry: huge portion, delicious broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, zucchini-meh, peppers, cabbage and baby corn. Savory gingery brothy sauce, perfectly seasoned beef which was pretty tender. I would get it again with just veg!\n\nGreen curry: sweet, spicy, very rich, very good. Yum, plus great roast pork. \n\nService was spot on, gorgeous plating, food came out very quickly at busy lunch time, check brought quickly, boxes offered without asking, and server answered all my questions perfectly and was super helpful.

Based on the number of phone calls they got and people coming in to get bags of food, they certainly seem to have a healthy flow of to-go business. The lady working the front wore quite a few hats so she was very busy, but she was also very nice and welcoming. Paper menus were available at the counter and it was seat yourself. You also pay at the counter, and make sure you specifically ask for a copy of the receipt if you need one.\n\nThe menu was massive and was more of a Southeast Asian place than just a Thai restaurant. The servings are massive, so you're either leaving stuffed or taking home leftovers, for which they had to-go boxes for. With the small, fairly busy setting, I don't think I would recommend this for something very intimate or formal, but it was delicious food for a good price. I really enjoyed the sweet and savory yellow curry noodle soup, and I heard positive remarks about the fried rice as well. We got some fried eggrolls for an appetizer that were great, and we heard that the wide variety of egg rolls and spring rolls are wrapped fresh.\n\nI don't think there is a lot more I would ask of a place like this, and it was certainly the best option for food in this fast food heavy part of town.","name":"Thai Asian Cuisine","address":"4337 E Butler Hill Rd","city":"St. Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63128","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":46,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","WheelchairAccessible":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"True","BikeParking":"True","Caters":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","OutdoorSeating":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","WiFi":"u'no'","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"True"},"categories":"Thai, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"m3OdEqB9n7sVWEncImtd7g","business_id":"z-_Gy3YNzYnr0Nb6BUyx7A","stars_x":5.0,"date":1562375727000,"text":"First time here and WOW!

For entrees we ordered Som Tum (Green papaya salad), Pad See Ew noodles, *Laard Naa noodles, Red curry with Tofu for the vegetarian, Basil Salmon, and Ginger sauce Grouper.

I'll ask for not spicy next time. Next out was Red curry with Tofu, to which we had asked to add pineapples. This was also on the more spicy end (server had not asked spice level). Maybe because I'm Thai, my husband and his parents are Indian, she assumed we all can handle spicy. Chicken Satay finally came out, and it was worth the wait -- very juicy & tender, well spiced. Next out came Grouper and Salmon dishes. While they were both, good, the portion size was small considering the price, so we likely won't order those again. Next out was Pad See Ew noodles, and last was Laard Naa noodles, which was *not on the menu*, but my daughter really wanted it and asked the server. Of course the chef could make it -- and it was delicious so she should add to her menu!

It's raw fish!  It's disgusting!\"  Then I left St. Louis and moved to Miami for several years, and if you've ever lived there, you're eventually going to try sushi.  It's inevitable.  It became my favorite food, instantly, toppling pizza from its perch (which I still love, but not as much as sushi.).  Back in St. Louis, you'd think it'd be hard to find decent sushi in a city in the almost exact center of the U. S. and you'd be right, I usually settle for okay, because it still tastes good and okay sushi is better than no sushi.  There is a place I frequent on Lemay Ferry that has really good sushi, but I hate driving, so I always look for somewhere closer.  Then this Thai restaurant opened in the Schnucks plaza on Butler Hill about three months ago.  For Christmas, I wanted sushi.  I know this is a Thai restaurant, but it has a sushi bar, I see it every time I walk to Schnucks.  So today on Christmas Eve, I went there and got spicy tuna rolls and a bit of salmon sashimi.  I was likely their first customer.  Not only are they as good as the other place, but they actually give you a substantial portion of sashimi.  The other place only gives you one piece.

Absolutely fantastic!  Our Pizza had a delightful fresh crispy thin crust and was lightly sauced (the way my wife likes it).  The italian sausage was a flavorful link sausage which had been it into slices.  The cheese tasted like some sort of blend, predominantly provel; we loved it.  This is St Louis Style Pizza at its best.  \n\nOur lasagna, on the other hand, was forgettable. It was a bit loose and there wasn't much ricotta or other yumminess. It was mostly meat sauce and noodles, with a slice of provel on top. \n\nI also had the dinner salad with the garlic vinaigrette. The salad was topped with a generous portion of provel and the dressing was great. I recommend it. \n\nThe atmosphere here is strictly low rent - padded metal chairs, Formica tables, and the original tile floor from the 60's, with a half dozen tiny 19 inch TVs on the wall. The staff was very friendly and we got the impression (by eavesdropping) that this place attracts a lot of regulars.

There is no deep dish and no hand tossed. You get your good ole thin crust pizza. My favorite pizza is the shrimp pizza. Don't be fooled, I was very reserved my first time, I wasn't sure that mini shrimp on a pizza would be good. Holy smokes, I crave this pizza all the time and we drive over 30 mins out of our way to enjoy it. I highly recommend it (don't forget to ask for extra shrimp). They also have your classic pizzas, we enjoy the Garbage pizza too (their name for supreme pizza). \nWe always start with toasted ravioli and garlic cheese bread. Two things you can't go wrong with either! \n\nThe atmosphere is very casual, they have TVs around with your favorite games on and you should grab a bucket of beer while you watch. Their buckets are a great price, unlike most places I go to these days that charge an insane amount for your basic bucket! \n\nStaff is always kind, friendly and smiling. Yes they are always busy, but it takes some patience for a great pizza and we never wait to be seated, even though every time we go, it's a full house! Janice is the owner and usually serves us as well. Talk about an amazing woman! She is so kind and makes each time we visit, a great experience. \n\nI would say, don't knock it until you try it.

First off, welcome to the new restaurant in Webster. The good news is you have time to get your sh@t together. We wanted to order Saturday night for dinner but after being open for just a week, they closed Saturday so, as their answering machine said, \"they could get prepared for the next week\"!!!  Really?  You chose to close for the busiest restaurant night of the week?? After only being open for a week?  Um, ok. Tonight we ordered online so I could pick it up on my way home from the gym. I show up on time only to be told by the apparent owner that online orders were being lost in their system, but if I got billed for it (so double billed) to let her know. Then, dripping wet from working out, I now had to place a new order, pay for it and wait 15 minutes for it. While waiting, I checked my bank account and of course had been double billed. I let the owner know, she checked my in store receipt, then disappeared in back without saying a word! I'll get my refund, trust me, I will, but on to the food. The Vietnamese ice coffees were both extremely bitter with seemingly no sweet creamer and nothing like we've ever had before anywhere. The fried shrimp rolls were tasty but very small, not jumbo shrimp, and came with no dipping sauce which they desperately needed. My combo vermicelli bowl was awesome but next time I'll ask for extra sauce (I chose the peanut sauce) because the sauce container is tiny. My wife got the vegan cheese rolls which were good, very small, and again no dipping sauce, which again we thought they were missing. She also had the Bahn Mi sandwich with chicken. She was disappointed and said \"bland flavor and just nothing special about it\".  We get the fact they are new and just opened in our hood, there are going to be screw ups and mistakes till you get things worked out, but you would think your online platform would be flawless in this day and age, or here's an idea, how about paying back the customers your system ripped off as soon as you are made aware of it or even not charge the customer for their reorder when they are standing right in front of you ??!!  Maybe they using my money to fund their crypto currency purchase? Ok, that was uncalled for and I'm being mean spirited, but I'm not taking it back. Maybe DD should contact their awesome neighbors at Sushi Station to see how to properly run an establishment in Webster. Pui would definitely set them on the right path to success. We will give them another chance because I'm sure things will get better. If they don't, some other restaurant will be filling their space in just a few short months.","name":"DD Mau Vietnamese Eatery","address":"20 Allen Ave","city":"Webster Groves","state":"MO","postal_code":"63119","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":38,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"NoiseLevel":"u'average'","RestaurantsTableService":"False","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': True, u'street': None, u'lot': True, u'validated': None}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","Ambience":"{u'divey': False, u'hipster': None, u'casual': None, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': None, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': None, u'classy': None, u'upscale': None}"},"categories":"Restaurants, Vietnamese"},{"review_id":"CIftolmso1CGwUZVLQ_yjg","business_id":"FljrXsruuoFB6v8InG-3Ig","stars_x":4.0,"date":1630787007000,"text":"Liked the food quite a bit, prices are pricey, takes a while to get your food.  First thing I noticed was that the food costs about double what stereotypical fast food costs, even though this is essentially the same stuff - but I suppose it should be much better.  And I was already there to try it out, so...placed the order and was told it would take 5 to 10 minutes.  And it took about 10 minutes, for 3 chicken sandwiches, 2 orders of fries, and 1 order of chicken fingers.  Seemed like  long time, but then it needed to be since the chicken was cooked up fresh.  I'd rather have it fresh an hot, so not a problem for me.\n\nThe chicken on both the sandwich and the fingers was juicy and flavorful, with a well-spiced (but not chili spice),  crispy coating.  They hit the mark there.  Don't know that it was twice as good as fast food, but it was good.  The sandwiches came with 4 bread & butter pickles.  They had a good snap, but not a lot of tartness in that variety.  I think a little bit of tart would have set off well from the chicken.  And the sandwiches came with mayo on them.  Personally, I'd have preferred to put one of their own sauces on the sandwich.\n\nFries were thinner than a typical crinkle cut, with a good peppery spice on them.  I though the fries were top notch.  And a generous portion too.\n\nYou have to get your own sauces from the dispensers, if you want more than just ketchup for your to go orders.  But the person giving me the bag informed me of that, so no problem.  And that way I could take extra, to make sure I didn't run out - and some for later.  We took some Andouille (I think) sauce, which was basically a spicy mayo with a sneaky heat - it was really good for dipping the fries; and took some of their \"secret sauce\", which was a sweetish, syrup thick sauce - hard for me to define it, but it made a good chicken dip.\n\nSo a decent experience overall.

Pleased to say that I agree with his enthusiasm.  This is a fast casual set up, and the menu board is set up pretty well to explain the options.  However, there are quite a few choices, so you might want to hang back and figure it out before stepping up to place your order.  When we arrived at about 6 pm on a Friday, it was pretty busy,  especially with people standing to take to go orders.  There were still a couple of 4 place tables open (along with a number of 2 place tables), so we snagged one.  But all the people standing around can make it difficult to get to a table.  Regardless, the food came out pretty quickly considering the number of orders that were before us - only 5-10 minutes and probably a dozen+ orders.\n\nAll of our food was really good.  My shrimp spring rolls were loaded with tender yet snappy and well seasoned large shrimp, along with fresh veggies.  Steak bao sliders were excellent, with savory shredded steak filling.  I am a sucker for good steamed bao buns.  There were warm, moist and soft without any gumminess.  I also got a combo banh mi, since I'm a hungry fool.    It had a nice variety of filling (shrimp, steak, etc), topped with a generous amount of fresh shredded veggies on a crunchy baguette with warm mayo.  A good sandwich, which it should be since they aren't too difficult to do and I usually get good ones from the various joints.\n\nThe wife and daughter raved over their rice bowls.  Since I didn't eat the bowls, I'll just have to go on their word.  The daughter's had pork, and the wife's had crispy tofu.  I did try a piece of the tofu, and it is notable.  A light breading on the extra firm fried tofu was something notable - I think even tofu non-eaters would enjoy it.  I could eat a serving of that by itself.","name":"DD Mau Vietnamese Eatery","address":"20 Allen Ave","city":"Webster Groves","state":"MO","postal_code":"63119","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":38,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"NoiseLevel":"u'average'","RestaurantsTableService":"False","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': True, u'street': None, u'lot': True, u'validated': None}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","Ambience":"{u'divey': False, u'hipster': None, u'casual': None, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': None, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': None, u'classy': None, u'upscale': None}"},"categories":"Restaurants, Vietnamese"},{"review_id":"4m7kFTQzysgaaxJgZ5_q4A","business_id":"FljrXsruuoFB6v8InG-3Ig","stars_x":4.0,"date":1630808648000,"text":"Not bad.

I have been by a couple of times but they were closed, unfortunately.  On Friday, I placed and order online for a pickup.  My pickup time was about 13 minutes from placing my order which was super quick.\n\nI ordered some spring rolls with pork and added shrimp for a starter, a bowl of pho with rare beef, and a vermicelli bowl with steak pieces and an extra egg added to the bowl.  During pickup, I went on the line because there wasn't a sign directing where people with online order pick-ups  should go. I got to the counter and the very friendly worker at the counter handed me my order.  They were still hot and fresh when I arrived (5 minutes or so drive).\n\nWhile I did not have the pho, it did look quite appetizing and smelled great.  My vermicelli bowl was okay.  The veggies were fresh and the protein of choice was quite flavorful but the noodles themselves were slightly undercooked just by a little bit.  I opted for the DD sauce and unfortunately, I find that I'm not a fan.  It kind of just made me think of a sweeter mayonnaise. Perhaps a different sauce would bring out better flavors.  I would definitely like to try something else more savory and less creamy\/mayonnaise-like.  The Vietnamese egg roll that came with my vermicelli bowl was okay, could have been slightly more flavorful and the egg was slightly too underdone for my liking -- uncooked egg whites surrounding the yolk.  There was no way to choose cooking preferences either. I wonder if I had dined inside if they would have had the option to cook it a little longer?\n\nBased on my experience, I would go with a 3 but I'd like to come back and give them another try as they do have a lot of different options.

You go to the counter to order and in a few short minutes the little steamer baskets arrived, neatly stacked. Before the dumplings arrived they brought us little bowls of chicken broth, simple but tasty. The dumplings were hot and moist. I can't say which one was best because they were all fantastic.   The server, who was the only employee I saw, was very friendly also. On the table they have a tray with soy sauce, hot chili paste, and I think vinegar. The people with me raved about the chili paste. It was too hot for me. The only suggestion I have is some dipping sauces. Dipping sauces may not be entirely authentic, but I like them.

The service is very subpar. I brought my parents here after coming with a group of friends. If you didn't know, you reserve a table (I would recommend by texting the number they provide) and order the food ahead of time. The ingredients are bought day of (I'm pretty sure) and just enough for the five tables in the restaurant. Everything is prepped as you're walking in (I would not be late). My parents were wowed by the quality of the peking duck and the skill it takes to cut it, the quality of the beef used, and the freshness of the pea tips. The taste is so delicious and leaves you wanting to eat so so much more. \n\nWe were a group of four and ordered (2) soup dumplings, a Peking duck, spicy beef, mushroom soup, pea tips with chicken broth, dried bean curd mixed with ma lan, house beef, and spicy beef. It was a LOT of food with enough leftovers for a full lunch the next day. \n\nAs for the service, it's best to say what my mom said: \"it's non-existent.\" Basically, the wife (the husband cooks in the back) just brings you whatever food has been prepared for you, not really looking out for the order of the guests. She was perfectly nice and had some conversation with us but we just wanted our food. We arrived a little bit before a full group arrived and we received three dishes before we were basically put on hold until the large group received close to 6 different dishes (took around 30 minutes between our 3rd and 4th dish. Keeping in mind that we only had 2 hours to eat) We were really hungry (and the food was so good) but there wasn't any care taken to balance out serving every guest. I also noticed that it took forever for them to serve the other smaller tables around us as well. I'm still giving this place five stars because the food is just that good.","name":"Private Kitchen","address":"8106 Olive Blvd","city":"University City","state":"MO","postal_code":"63130","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","Alcohol":"u'none'","WiFi":"u'no'","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","Ambience":"{'touristy': None, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': True, 'trendy': None, 'upscale': None, 'classy': None, 'casual': None}","RestaurantsTableService":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': None, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","NoiseLevel":"u'quiet'","OutdoorSeating":"False","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"3","GoodForKids":"False"},"categories":"Chinese, Restaurants, Shanghainese, American (Traditional)"},{"review_id":"PPDtkOOBET-KJ-0yJijvdg","business_id":"T7Mg8BZo1ZWpoiZP64D7-A","stars_x":5.0,"date":1446053471000,"text":"Thoroughly enjoyable dinner.

We learned that that the best way to make a reservation was to use a chat app, otherwise calling the restaurant is hit or miss.\nThere were only 2 other groups at our dinner time, another table of 8 and a group of 4. The 3 total tables filled the restaurant and kept Mrs Yang, our hostess and wife of the chef busy the rest of the evening! They only offered 2 wines, but we brought our own for a $10 corkage fee.\n\nOur first dish was the famous Xiao Long Bao, as others described. It's a small, bite-sized dumpling, filled with tender, savory ground pork, bathed in a rich stock, clothed in a soft wrap and steamed in a bamboo basket. What a first course!\nNext came the Peking Duck. Crisp skin, succulent meat, well seasoned. It was served with finely juilienned fresh cucumber and scallions (great knife skills!) and the traditional sweet hoisin sauce. The rest of the duck was served in a separate platter, which was emptied in 5 minutes!\nWe also had the steamed fresh groupa fish. Traditional simple chinese style with sesame oil, soy sauce, ginger and scallions. True to our group, I wish I took an \"after\" picture to show you how well we cleaned off the fish bones! \nWe then had the tamarind crab, it was the most delectable crab I've ever had! Coming from Singapore where crab is king (I've had Chili crab, Black Pepper crab, salted egg yolk crab, steamed crab), this tamarind crab is to die for! Delicious mix of umami, sweet and salty, the crab was large and full of meat! Well seasoned, the flavor was full with every bite. \nWith the guidance of another friend who's a regular, we ordered another of their specialties, the Lion's Head Meatball (loosely translated). As Mrs Yang explained, this dish requires the most amount of time and effort!. The meat is hand chopped, not machine ground. Seasoned, the made into meatballs the size of baseballs! They are stuffed into chicken and simmered for hours. The meatballs are served with the flavor infused broth and a single head of baby bak choy, all in a beautiful white porcelain bowl with it's own wrought-iron stand.\nWe also ordered the shrimp fried rice, which was al dente rice and not clumpy. We also had spicy tofu (similar to Ma Po Tofu) which was flavored with fermented beans and chili. The sweet and sour eggplant with green peppers was another hit. We lastly got a mushroom soup, with 3 kinds of mushrooms. It was simple, not oily, a perfect closer to the savory entrees. \n\nFor dessert, we had 2 kinds of dessert, the default is often the \"potted plant\". It's a really artful serving of white porcelain bowl in a the shape of mini square vase. In it is selected vanilla ice cream that's not too sweet or creamy, on top is a layer of semi-sweet cocoa granules, with a single baby carnation sitting the middle, creating the potted plant appearance. Brilliant, playful. The other dessert we got was the housemade, traditional, fermented sweet rice with tapioca pearls. This was a hit! A perfect, truly final closer to our Shanghainese gastronomic experience!\n\nOur 10 course meal came up to less than $40 per person for a group of 7. Truly a steal for such culinary extravaganza! Each dish had it's own unique flavor. Unlike many places, where one sauce was used for everything and most dishes tasted the same, the food here at Private Kitchen clearly shines through with the Yang's love for the preparation and presentation of meals as a labor of their passion.","name":"Private Kitchen","address":"8106 Olive Blvd","city":"University City","state":"MO","postal_code":"63130","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","Alcohol":"u'none'","WiFi":"u'no'","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","Ambience":"{'touristy': None, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': True, 'trendy': None, 'upscale': None, 'classy': None, 'casual': None}","RestaurantsTableService":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': None, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","NoiseLevel":"u'quiet'","OutdoorSeating":"False","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"3","GoodForKids":"False"},"categories":"Chinese, Restaurants, Shanghainese, American (Traditional)"},{"review_id":"MKbGXQigxfKZS_reVa3k9w","business_id":"76JM9BdE_XRzuYCVgZvcCA","stars_x":5.0,"date":1528120669000,"text":"A great neighborhood spot.

The food was amazing! When I called to set up my reservation, Lawrence, the owner and chef asked me what I wanted to order so that he could buy the ingredients the day of for extra freshness. It was an interesting experience that I'd never had before in the states for a full meal, and added to the anticipation. Also, clever business model! We started with the steamed dumplings which were hot but so flavorful, especially with the vinegar sauce, that it was totally worth the scalding! Then came the peking duck, which came with little rice buns and plum sauce for sandwiches. The skin was so crispy and the meat so juicy that my sister giggled in enjoyment as she ate it. It was that good. That one had to be ordered two days in advance, which was fine, as they require reservations. Then came Chinese broccoli, which looked like broccoli rabe in a sweet sauce, black pepper beef, which was cubed and maybe fried? also in a sweeter sauce and finally shrimp with the heads still on. We were encouraged to eat the shell and it was totally worth it! Added a bit of crunch! The rest of the duck, which wasn't immediately served, was turned into a broth for the end of the meal. No waste! The owner's wife is the only wait staff and it gets a bit crazy when all the tables were full (on a random Monday night!), but she handled it well.

We had slow-cooked pork knuckle, steamed chicken, sweet and sour fish (squirrel fish)  and bean curd with crab roe. The presentation was good, and ingredients were fresh. The pork knuckle was well done, collagen rich but a little grease-laden. The sizzling squirrel fish was crispy and coated in homemade sauce.

It was a strange experience.\nI've read all the reviews so I know it's a husband making all the food and the wife running the front of the house.\nThanks to fellow Yelpers, I was able to text our order based on their Facebook photos and since it was a special occasion, we ordered way too much food because it all sounded so good!\n\nWe arrived 10 minutes earlier than our reservation at 8pm since we were starving and they managed to seat us immediately.\nBut then after that, the lady proceeded to ignore us besides refilling our water till 8:30. I'm also 9 months pregnant and starving at this point so maybe I was a little crankier than usual.\nMy husband and his cousin both speak Chinese fluently and my husband politely asked around 8:15 if we could get served soon. She told him that she can only serve one table at a time, which is perplexing because there were other 2 full tables that she was waiting on already, sooo...???\nThen at 8:30 my cousin-in-law told her that we had been waiting nearly 45 minutes and the lady's response was \"It has NOT been 45 minutes\" and rolled her eyes at her. We told her would leave if we didn't get food in the next five minutes and she looked annoyed but immediately started bringing out the food.\n\nThe one saving grace was that the food was so delicious, I'm still thinking about it one week later. Every single dish was beautifully made and so tasty. We were bursting by the end of it but had two days worth of leftovers which totally made it worth it.\n\nWe tried:\nPeking duck (perfection, and I like that they gave us all the parts)\nSpicy lobster (more sweet than spicy, in a good way)\nFoie gras and black truffle over steamed egg (last dish served, so heavy and perfect)\n3 ingredient vegetable--sunchokes, peppers, and eggplant in a sweetened soy sauce (I would go back just for this dish)\nHouse beef (Crispy fried beef, I'm still dreaming about this one)\nLion Head soup (Shanghai specialty, perfect starter to the meal)\nMushroom soup (If you like mushrooms, this one's for you)\nPork Soup Dumplings (another Shanghai specialty, best I've had out of Shanghai)\n\nWe actually also ordered the Drunken crab but they texted me saying they didn't have it because the market didn't have very good crab. I responded with \"ok that's fine\", Then the day of the dinner, I got another text from them saying \"You have enough food, you don't need the crab\", to which I simply responded with \"ok\". Not sure if that text was meant for me but it was weird.\n\nEven stranger, the two tables that had already been eating when we arrived most definitely had crab on their tables!\n\nOur total came to $175 before tax and the food was well worth it. But I can't say I enjoyed the experience. The lady who works the front of the house clearly hates her job. I could excuse some of her bad service if communication was a problem but the fact that we had two people who could speak in her native language and she was still so rude was just odd. Not to mention she was offering wine to the other tables and never did so to us. She seemed to have decided to dislike us from the moment we walked in, and we never figured out why.\n\nI was still going to give this 5 stars but all I'm craving is that house beef and the 3 ingredient vegetables and we tried to order it to go today, and apparently they don't do any take out, which I just don't understand! I would love to bypass the service and eat their delicious food on my own terms at home but I guess I can't have that. \n\nI'm still glad we tried it and I do recommend it, just be prepared for a unique experience!\nIt's also too bad that the owners will likely never read these reviews because they could probably really benefit from the feedback.","name":"Private Kitchen","address":"8106 Olive Blvd","city":"University City","state":"MO","postal_code":"63130","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","Alcohol":"u'none'","WiFi":"u'no'","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","Ambience":"{'touristy': None, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': True, 'trendy': None, 'upscale': None, 'classy': None, 'casual': None}","RestaurantsTableService":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': None, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","NoiseLevel":"u'quiet'","OutdoorSeating":"False","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"3","GoodForKids":"False"},"categories":"Chinese, Restaurants, Shanghainese, American (Traditional)"},{"review_id":"OClznLu4lxSsmu7BZXJc1Q","business_id":"T7Mg8BZo1ZWpoiZP64D7-A","stars_x":3.0,"date":1484165443000,"text":"You have to make reservation ahead.

The service was a lot better than I expected, she smiled a lot and asked if we liked it every now and then. \n\nWe ordered lamb chops, spicy vegetable sauce and pork dumplings. It was all sooo flavorful. The pork dumplings were brought out first and ohhh boy, They were small but mighty. The gooey but savory dumplings paired well with the rice vinegar dip. They were so tasty we regret not ordering more in advanced. \n \nNext the spicy vegetable sauce came out. It was served with white rice. I loovvveee meat so I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this dish.

I've been told that everything here is cooked in a traditional Shanghainese fashion (aka a lot more similar to NE Chinese style cooking, with lighter flavor profiles.) The husband does all the cooking in the back room, and the wife does the serving. There are a few larger tables seating 6-8 people, and some smaller 2 people tables. The place was pretty full when we arrived, and the first thing I noticed was how quiet it was inside.... Or maybe our group was just too rowdy. This would probably be a great place to have a relaxing family dinner or a business dinner, without having to worry about yelling over music or crowd noise. Service was slow in the beginning while the tables before us were getting served, but quickly picked up, with one dish brought after another. \n\nBooking: This was apparently a PITA, and required a lot of back and forth texting. You can find the contact number, as well as the menu items, on their Facebook page. You're supposed to place all orders during time of booking, so coordinate ahead with your group. \n\nI have nothing bad to say about the food, so I'll just list them with personal favs at the very top: \n+ Yangzhou lion head \n- served on a per person basis, but could easily be split with others, as the meat is very tender and easy to break off\n- pork meatballs will never be the same again after you've had this\n- comes with yummy broth that's great to drink up or pour over your rice \n\n+ soup dumpling with crab roe (\"xiao long bao\")\n- just as good as the original pork version\n- ample soup inside the bun (don't bite directly into the center or else the hot soup will splash everywhere)\n\n+ slow cooked pork knuckles\n- meat is literally falling off the bone (it's like the Chinese version of Texas bbq :D)\n- don't forget to eat the flavor infused skin\n\n+ Peking duck\n- not as meaty as the ones I'm used to in Beijing, but just as delicious \n- perfectly crispy skin with tender juicy meat on the inside\n- the steamed buns for stuffing are equally heavenly (too bad they're limited, as I could've easily gone for eating just the buns by themselves... They were THAT good)\n\n+ baby pork rib in plum sauce: I still can't get over the bonsai tree garnish, comes with some pieces of plum for good measure (be careful that you don't bite into the plum pit)\n\n+ steamed chicken with green onion: light \/ mild (\"dan\") flavor profile with just the right amount of seasoning and none of the overwhelming starchy sauce that Americanized Chinese places add (if you're not used to authentic Chinese food, this dish may not be for you) \n\n+ steamed whole live fish: also light flavor profile\n\nMore importantly, the chopsticks are labeled 'Private Chicken' (someone uploaded a pic of this already.) I still can't get over it.\n\nUPDATE: After coming here a few more times, I've realized that some dishes are just a miss for me. I still maintain that if you want Peking duck, this is probably the best place in Saint Louis to go to. Also, this is a great place for formal gatherings and to impress your co-workers with. However, I personally prefer Tai Ke and Chef Ma's for Chinese food, especially with the added convenience.","name":"Private Kitchen","address":"8106 Olive Blvd","city":"University City","state":"MO","postal_code":"63130","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","Alcohol":"u'none'","WiFi":"u'no'","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","Ambience":"{'touristy': None, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': True, 'trendy': None, 'upscale': None, 'classy': None, 'casual': None}","RestaurantsTableService":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': None, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","NoiseLevel":"u'quiet'","OutdoorSeating":"False","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"3","GoodForKids":"False"},"categories":"Chinese, Restaurants, Shanghainese, American (Traditional)"},{"review_id":"63qMlgmWl7dKOKbXtYgCng","business_id":"T7Mg8BZo1ZWpoiZP64D7-A","stars_x":5.0,"date":1458012672000,"text":"New in St Louis but high quality.

Seating is by reservation only, and you must submit your order when you make the reservation.  Look on their Facebook page for the menu.  These appear to be dishes from China, and not what you find on \"Americanized\" menus, so they may not be familiar to you, like they were not to me.  So I did the best I could based on descriptions.\n\nThe restaurant itself is nondescript from outside.  Inside is a cozy place with about a half dozen tables of various sizes, nicely done up with actual tablecloths and cloth chair covers.  Our waitress (co-owner?) was the only worker we saw, save a few glimpses of the chef (owner?) coming out of the back for a few moments.  She was very nice the entire time, smiled a lot, spoke briefly (semi-halting English), and filled our waters frequently.  She did a good job of observing our progress on the courses, so that our plates were removed as they emptied and next course arrived quickly after we both finished the previous one - except we had a few minutes before dessert to let the dinner settle.  The serving order was different from what I would have expected in that soup dumplings (dim sum) came first, then one entree, then another entree partly through the first entree, then soup came last, followed by dessert.  Entree order was fine, but it seemed odd to have soup come so late.\n\nSoup dumplings are what they are famous for, and are excellent if you like dim sum.  Thin and tender steamed shells (quite attractively packaged) well filled.  We had pork and crab ones.  Both were good.  Of course, you slurp out the broth inside from a small hole you make, or else it just spills onto the plate.\n\nChicken with chestnuts was good, too.  I'd never had chestnuts other than roasted over an open fire.  These were very tender, almost like a mushroom, but not quite that soft.\n\nCrispy beef (not the name, but my description), was terrific.  A big mound of small bits of beef that were almost candied in a thick glaze\/sauce.  Mostly savory, but with a bit of sweetness in the glaze - seemed like it was probably from honey.\n\nHouse soup was a bit of a disappointment.  Broth was too bland for my preferences, and the pork meat (seemed to be pork belly) was kind of tough with the fat portions sometimes being gristly.  Bamboo shoots in the soup were large and with a very slight crunch, and pretty good.  Tofu \"knots\" were delicious, and plentiful.  They seem to be made from a stack of thin sheets of tofu that are cut into strips and then tied into knots.  They are not mushy at all like tofu might get in a soup, and had a pleasant snap when bit into.  They also absorbed the flavor of the broth well.\n\nDessert was the potted plant ice cream - A real flower was stuck in the top, with finely ground chocolate for dirt and ice cream under.  Pretty cute, fairly tasty.","name":"Private Kitchen","address":"8106 Olive Blvd","city":"University City","state":"MO","postal_code":"63130","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","Alcohol":"u'none'","WiFi":"u'no'","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","Ambience":"{'touristy': None, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': True, 'trendy': None, 'upscale': None, 'classy': None, 'casual': None}","RestaurantsTableService":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': None, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","NoiseLevel":"u'quiet'","OutdoorSeating":"False","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"3","GoodForKids":"False"},"categories":"Chinese, Restaurants, Shanghainese, American (Traditional)"},{"review_id":"aL8eJoB6Rf49874BY4AW8Q","business_id":"76JM9BdE_XRzuYCVgZvcCA","stars_x":2.0,"date":1501186633000,"text":"This place is ALMOST a nice neighborhood bar.

I will say the wife\/server was really nice and friendly often joking with us. But they had Tsingtao beer on hand, not bad, but essentially Chinese Budweiser and they had a nice red cab for wine. This was a family event so we ordered literally 16 courses family style, which was WAY too much food. But I'll mention what I thought was good to know stuff.\n\nShaoxing Drunken Chicken - This was a cold dish, but very unique in flavor with a subtle rice wine flavor and not something you can find a lot of places, probably my favorite dish of the night. \n\nBaby Pork Rib - a little sour because of the plum and too sweet for me. Just didn't really mesh well as a meat dish.\n\nHouse cooked beef - probably my second favorite dish. Soy sauce braised, but still had a sugary sweet sheen on it that kept it from being transcendent.\n\nShrimp and Crab Roe Soup Dumpling - very seafoody taste, which could be a good thing I suppose, but I prefer the pork dumpling.\n\nPotted Plant - Visually really appealing, it's a real flower atop oreo crumbles and we got a vanilla ice cream\/strawberry yogurt mix underneath, almost wish it was mostly just ice cream.\n\nOutside of these dishes, everything else we got was really good, flavorful and authentic. Hard to mention much about the stuff like steamed fish other than that it was good and tasted like it was supposed to for all 15 dishes.","name":"Private Kitchen","address":"8106 Olive Blvd","city":"University City","state":"MO","postal_code":"63130","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","Alcohol":"u'none'","WiFi":"u'no'","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","Ambience":"{'touristy': None, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': True, 'trendy': None, 'upscale': None, 'classy': None, 'casual': None}","RestaurantsTableService":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': None, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","NoiseLevel":"u'quiet'","OutdoorSeating":"False","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"3","GoodForKids":"False"},"categories":"Chinese, Restaurants, Shanghainese, American (Traditional)"},{"review_id":"qcfuyCYqHO3f9HLbXGin-A","business_id":"AegBDOGq8gbixKBb-UfO6w","stars_x":2.0,"date":1563207891000,"text":"Walking in the diner it is very clean and well set up.

Great Asian bakery selection from day one. Made me a chicken feet in wine sauce addict! Awesome BBQ pork, duck, and breads and a very balanced fu qi fei pian seasoning for their build your own option. \n\nI almost always get something when I go grocery shopping, and with the expansion my wish for a dining option inside has been granted! Now I also almost always choose to go shopping here so I can eat inside. \n\nNote: the hours are not the same as the store but I can't remember what cuz it kept changing for a while. Right now they take a break around 230-330? And close at 730p before the store does.\n\nThe selection on the dine in side is pared down, but that means all the foods come quickly. I love all the dry noodle options except the Dan Dan noodle (way overboard on the numbing). The pho was a miss - very bland broth. I usually don't order fried rice so I don't know about those. The few other non rice\/noodle are ok, kind of leans toward Chinese-American but taste good - I like the garlic pork (yu xiang rou si). Usually I go for beef chow fun or Beijing style zha jiang mian, but the Taiwan style rice noodle stir fry is a new favorite. \n\nThe only knock I have is that ever since they expanded they haven't been 100% knocking it out of the park every time like they were before. A few times, my bbq pork wasn't as seasoned, my duck was a little dry another time, my spicy chicken a little less fragrant, etc. But they seem to be working out the kinks more because it's less and less so the case and I'm hopeful. Don't be disappointed if your first visit isn't amazing and keep supporting this small local business trying to figure things out! \n\nI pretty much don't go anywhere else for a quick Chinese meal or groceries anymore because they make it so convenient for me!","name":"China Bistro","address":"14246 Manchester Rd","city":"Manchester","state":"MO","postal_code":"63011","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":35,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","HasTV":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': None, 'street': None, 'validated': None, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","Ambience":"{u'divey': False, u'hipster': None, u'casual': True, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': False, u'intimate': False, u'romantic': False, u'classy': False, u'upscale': False}","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","GoodForKids":"True"},"categories":"Restaurants, Chinese, Szechuan"},{"review_id":"ExZ__DgR7NyOghEN3HAPQw","business_id":"76JM9BdE_XRzuYCVgZvcCA","stars_x":5.0,"date":1535905314000,"text":"This bar has everything on my wishlist for a neighborhood spot:\n1.)

Terrific fine dining experience in St. Louis. As others have mentioned, you must make a reservation and order in advance over text. Food is 5 stars, plain and simple. Soup dumplings are soft, chewy, and served elegantly with vinegar--definitely get an order or two of these. Dish of the night, though, for me was the steamed fish--it was served whole with a delicate, simple soy, ginger sauce with shredded vegetables. I'm still thinking about this fish the next day! Chinese broccoli was also delicious--simple but had an almost herbal flavor to it. Goes really well with the fish! Spicy beef was good--nice spicing with chili and lots of black pepper, but the sauce was a little sweet\/goopy for my liking. Chicken with chestnuts was interesting--the chicken was nice, and the chestnuts were soft, but I don't think I'd order this dish again. In the past I've had the spare ribs, house beef, etc. But I don't remember enough about them to give a judgement. I didn't order those again, though, bc I remember the spare ribs being fatty, and the house beef fried. The Peking Duck I also ordered on a past visit, and it was out-of-this-world! Definitely a must if you're a big party. We finished with the ice cream in a plant pot which is a cool gimmick but didn't taste special at all. Probably wouldn't order again. Overall, though, the food at private kitchen is top notch. \nNon-food stuff: the restaurant is simple, small, and quiet, and I appreciated that. Definitely best for parties of 4-6. The service is...not that good. The one server is a sweet middle aged lady (the place is a couple's operation), and she is very nice, but since she is the only server, things are slooow. Don't expect to get your water refilled more than once throughout the meal, and I don't think they clear the tables of food until you leave. That's not a big deal for me, but we did have to stare a fish skeleton in the eye sockets for at least 15 minutes before (and during) dessert, which was less than ideal. This isn't the biggest gripe in the world, but it was enough to knock it down half a star, in combination with the fact that the prices are decently high. \nSo, as I said, overall 4.5 stars.

But I am in love with the owners for branching out and opening a location closer to where we live now! I stopped by on a Friday night a few weeks ago to place a carry-out order. I was pleasantly surprised to see that there were other guests in the restaurant enjoying meals. The shop itself is located in the Butler Hill shopping center right off of 55 so it's a convenient location for lots of people. Inside there are probably about 10 tables and they have a self-serve soda machine. I was able to walk right up to the counter to place my order and the guy taking my order was friendly and helpful. Once I placed my order and paid for it, they told me it would be a few minutes so I just hung out. \n\nThis place is clearly a family owned place and I really like that! They take pride in their food and service so I can see them being around for a while! When my order was ready, the guy came out to bring it to me all packed and ready to go. Since I also ordered a slice of baklava, he came out to the dining room and went to the fridge to select a slice for me; he was awesome, because he made sure to find the biggest slice he could find, which I appreciated! \n\nWithin 15 minutes, I was able to place an order, get my food and be on my way. This was an efficient visit and I will be back again. Their gyros are really good; I am partial to the chicken gyro which wasn't too dry and had a nice flavor to it. They top their gyros with lots of fresh ingredients and you can ask for some fresh feta too!

Beverages, condiments and the like are self-service. I didn't see a place for trash or to put dirty dishes, so I left those at the table when finished. The people were friendly, but three stars seems appropriate for a partially self-service situation. \n\nThe menu seems to specialize in noodle bowl and soup-type dishes. They also have a limited number of what appear to be Peking ducks hanging in a case, as well as a selection of cakes and buns. I ordered a large bowl of pho with beef. \n\nThe broth was light-colored and not too greasy. It was on the sweeter side than I prefer, I think the cinnamon and star anise were dominant, but I'm no expert on Vietnamese flavors. The beef was not the thin, raw slices that many places offer, which cooks in the hot broth. These were more like strips of fully cooked meat. The bowl was accompanied by rhe standard plate of bean sprouts, cilantro, basil and lime. Overall, it was a pretty good bowl. Not the best ever, but above average to my taste. \n\nThe prices were very reasonable. It was a good experience, especially adding in the chance to browse the market or do some shopping before or after lunch.","name":"China Bistro","address":"14246 Manchester Rd","city":"Manchester","state":"MO","postal_code":"63011","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":35,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","HasTV":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': None, 'street': None, 'validated': None, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","Ambience":"{u'divey': False, u'hipster': None, u'casual': True, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': False, u'intimate': False, u'romantic': False, u'classy': False, u'upscale': False}","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","GoodForKids":"True"},"categories":"Restaurants, Chinese, Szechuan"},{"review_id":"yRA4McAWKSTFs5DlXxVbAA","business_id":"T7Mg8BZo1ZWpoiZP64D7-A","stars_x":3.0,"date":1431009466000,"text":"I just want to cry when I see General Tso's chicken & other Americanized Chinese dishes offered at a joint like this.

The wife I assume serves & gets the food, while the husband I assume cooks.  I agree with previous review about the Peking Duck being delish.  However, & a big however, I was told by the wife that the duck must be ordered 2 days in advance.  He makes it from scratch.  Super cool.  The menu is in Chinese for the most part.

Since then Thurman's has basically been closed the whole time as it has transitioned ownership.  Last night, we decided to walk to the corner of Thurman and Shenandoah (downtown Shaw) for dinner with our 10 month old baby. \n\nWe've been following the announcements on social media as the new Thurman's has added to its menu.  First it was just the drinks.  Then came salads.  Now, they offer burgers, fries, chicken sandwiches, chili, and many entree salads.\n\nWhen we arrived, we planned to sit outside on the patio where there are long communal tables. The only problem was there were smokers, so with the baby we headed inside.  The music playing was all jazz and MoTown. We grabbed a high top table. I went to the bar to order drinks, a glass of cabernet for her and a local IPA for me. All the draft selections were from local craft breweries: Urban Chestnut, Civil Life, Four Hands, O'Fallon, Schlafly, and Griesedieck's.  In bottles were macro swill and a fascinating list of Belgian beers, including a Flander's Red sour.  The selection isn't a long list yet, but I'm very impressed so far.\n\nWe both had cheese burgers with a basket of fries to share.  My wife also had the caesar salad.  All the food was tasty and right on bar for a neighborhood bar.  The burgers were simple and juicy without pretension.\n\nWe're very excited to have a new food option down the block.

Portions are big enough to share. The soup is A LOT. \nAgain, just the one server and her sweatpants serving the other two tables. One was a party of eight. We rarely got checked on and water was scarce. Once you're done with the meal - out you go. She did give some boxes for our leftovers - but we boxed it ourselves. The food was fine. The dumplings were definitely the high point.

I had wanted a vinaigrette dressing, but apparently that's too classy for this place.  They only had 3 different salad dressings, so I was forced to pick  ranch.  The only flavor on the sandwich was the horseradish.  The meat was bland, bland, bland.  The \"server\" had no idea how to wait tables.  There were 4 people at our table.  Took her 2 trips to bring 4 drinks.  Took her 3 trips to bring everyone's order.  At the end of the meal I asked the \"server\" for a box for the other 1\/2 of my sandwich.  Even though it wasn't the best I never let food go to waste.  Sit there a while talking and waiting and this dumb little girl basically asked us if we were leaving. I glared at her and said I'm waiting for the box that I requested.  Maybe if this place spent more time hiring wait staff with talent and a brain instead of who looks good in a bra and mini skirt, they might actually be crowded on a Sat night.

From one industry professional to another, don't the haters get you down. Karma's a bitch \n\nBack to our experience: we were greeted by two, a trainee with a shadow. I believe they introduced themselves as \"M.L.\" Or maybe... Em Elle? Anyway, they were wonderful. And the shadow trainer was present but did not enter the conversation unless needed, creating a good boost of confidence for the trainee. Both had great recommendations on cocktails, apps, pizza, entrees and wine. We felt very welcome. \n\nTo start off we both got a Black Manhattan, it was so smooth. The booze sort of snuck up on us. (Not to insinuate it wasn't boozy, we felt it ). On the servers' recommendation we moved on to the Calimari. OMFG - wow. Never had a Calimari without a dipping sauce before, but it did not need it, giardiniera  was fried in with it and it was bursting with complimentary flavors. \n\nFor entrees, bday lady got the eggplant parm and we split a pizza. She said the texture was a little weird for her, but the flavor was awesome. Neither of us are red-meat eaters, so we got the sausage-ricotta-giardiniera pizza, minus the sausage. We also splurged on a side of the house made hot honey. It was upscale flavor town, like guy fieri in a tux. seriously tho, it was yum. \n\nThe ambiance was totally our cup of tea.

We went during the week to avoid what we thought would be crowds. We ordered the handmade toasted ravioli which we extremely tasty and I would stack up against any handmade ravioli on the Hill. Next we split the Caesar salad with hot croutons and I would stay that this was great as well. Lastly we decided on a pizza since this is (should be) their specialty since it's in their name, we were extremely DISPOINTED in this. We found this supposedly New Haven style pizza to be terrible, the pizza crust was soggy especially in the middle. I am not sure if they have not fine-tuned their recipe or need a better pizza oven or are afraid of a little charred crust, but they need to work on cooking the pie all the way through and need to perfect this if they want to keep \"Pizza\" in the name.\n\nThe drinks as at Olive & Oak were excellent.

They require customers to put their mask on each time a waitress or any employee approaches you table. I understand the need to be careful, but this is overkill and very annoying for the table, stopping in mid bite to put your mask on or just constantly trying to pay attention to what the employees are doing in case they come near your table is not a relaxing night out. As customers, we all understand the risk associated with dining out and if we are in your restaurant we are comfortable with that risk. If you as a restaurant or your employees are fearful then; 1) DO Not OPEN, 2) Do not come to work if you are an employee, or 3) Protect you staff further with either face shields or even have them put on fully biohazard suits (this is overkill, but so is putting mask on and off 20 times during a night out).","name":"O+O Pizza","address":"102 W Lockwood Ave","city":"St. Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63119","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":38,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Ambience":"{u'divey': False, u'hipster': False, u'casual': False, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': False, u'intimate': False, u'romantic': False, u'classy': True, u'upscale': False}","OutdoorSeating":"True","GoodForKids":"True"},"categories":"Bars, Pizza, Nightlife, Restaurants, Italian"},{"review_id":"b_TktU9qa0V3a3bm3EN7Pw","business_id":"97w1oemqGL_I-gchNIHZGw","stars_x":5.0,"date":1625692573000,"text":"We stopped in for drinks only at O+O Pizza last night to celebrate our daughter's 21st birthday, and had ML and Kyle take outstanding care of us!

It's hot and sour with a hint of pear. \nThere was a mocktail with turmeric and ginger,the name is slipping from my mind, but it was the most unique flavorful drink I've ever had!\n\nFried gnocchi: The mix of the crunch and soft center is pleasing, it's a light appetizer which pairs well with our drinks.\n\nRigatoni: Yummy! This warm creamy pasta was split for the two of us, and the portion was more than enough. The sauce is seasoned well, the Rigatoni melts in your mouth, and the small pieces of lobster make the whole dish smell and taste absolutely divine!\n\nMargherita pizza: This was so underwhelming :(.

The restaurant is a whole six tables large, and operates on a reservation only basis. For us Americans, the restaurant can be contacted via Facebook (https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/privatekitchenstl\/?fref=ts) or phone number. And if you have a WeChat, apparently they do reservations through there as well. While making the reservation, you also pre-order from the menu and they purchase the ingredients beforehand (most dishes can also be ordered during dinner, but some, like Peking duck, require ~3 day advance notice). Communication is a lot easier if you or someone you're with speaks Chinese and can handle reservations and ordering.\n\nI've been a couple times, both with a smaller group and larger group of people. I'd say it's better to go family style with a larger group of people, since there are so many good dishes and you'll want to try them all. \n\nYou'll definitely want to try the Peking duck, along with the XLB soup dumplings.

They were also a lot more expensive ($25 for two orders) than I'd had in the past. The staff, however, was very sweet.","name":"Private Kitchen","address":"8106 Olive Blvd","city":"University City","state":"MO","postal_code":"63130","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","Alcohol":"u'none'","WiFi":"u'no'","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","Ambience":"{'touristy': None, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': True, 'trendy': None, 'upscale': None, 'classy': None, 'casual': None}","RestaurantsTableService":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': None, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","NoiseLevel":"u'quiet'","OutdoorSeating":"False","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"3","GoodForKids":"False"},"categories":"Chinese, Restaurants, Shanghainese, American (Traditional)"},{"review_id":"BEBbTeNMD9tMdnlQh21ddA","business_id":"97w1oemqGL_I-gchNIHZGw","stars_x":4.0,"date":1614012914000,"text":"Got O&O for V-day carryout because we wanted a less expensive and easier to transport meal than Olive & Oak.\n\nWe started with the meatballs and the gnocchi apps. Holy smokes, the gnocchi was the best thing we ate.  Served with pork belly in a rosemary cider cream sauce, I could have most likely eaten this as my entree.  Gnocchi was pillowy and whole dish was stellar and complex.  The polenta and ragu that was served with the meatballs was also tasty but I felt that the meatball texture was off, a big spongy, too tightly packed.\n\nThe Caesar salad was tasty though the croutons were more like large pieces of crispy bread.  Tasted great but were challenging to eat as a part of the salad.\n\nWhile it's O&O Pizza, we didn't actually get pizza...  For entrees we tried the lobster rigatoni and the agnolotti.  The rigatoni was a surprise favorite.  My husband was suspect of lobster in his pasta, but upon tasting it, we both agreed it was a fantastic dish.  The calabrian chilies added a bit of spice that cut the richness from the cream sauce. There was also a surprisingly hefty portion of lobster, yay!  The agnolotti was a miss.  The pasta was great but the garlic butter sauce and the sun-dried tomatoes added zero flavor.  I would like to see this pasta preparation revamped.  Slap some of that rosemary cider cream on them! \n\nAll in all, good price for the quality of the food, easy ordering app and curbside pick-up.

If you can speak Chinese, type in Chinese. The wife isn't super comfortable with English, and I overheard her saying she ignores phone calls during service hours so the husband\/chef can take them later, and they are much friendlier over text in Chinese too and it will make the reso process so much easier\/faster.\n\nTheir menu is also on Facebook (https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/privatekitchenstl no website), so you just scroll through that and type in your order via text. We didn't get a confirmation or anything. No one even asked for our name. But we just showed up and they knew. It's all good.\n\nAs for what to eat... This was the best Xiao Long Bao I've had like EVER. I have eaten them in China and in the US all over, and these are delicious. Perfect texture and flavor filling, and perfectly delicate skin. Can't get them in Chicago. Can't get them in NYC or China or any Ding Tai Fung without a long ass wait. Next time we come, we are ordering just dumplings. Come here if only for that.\n\nWhole steamed fish is a very traditional, simple preparation w\/ scallion and ginger and soy that I enjoy making at home, but they do it very well here without you having to go through the pains of finding a fish that's fresh and keeping it so. \n\nThe only misses we had were Kung pao chicken (weird chocolaty taste and texture) and the pork ribs (too sweet).

Honestly, it's not the flavor that sets this place but the absolute perfect execution of texture.  \n\nIf you are in town, this is a must try.","name":"Soulard Gyro","address":"4337 Butler Hill Rd","city":"St. Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63128","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":25,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Caters":"True","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Corkage":"False","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"False","OutdoorSeating":"False","BYOB":"False","Alcohol":"u'none'","WiFi":"u'free'","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': None, u'street': None, u'lot': None, u'validated': False}","Ambience":"{u'divey': False, u'hipster': None, u'casual': True, u'touristy': None, u'trendy': None, u'intimate': False, u'romantic': None, u'classy': None, u'upscale': False}","RestaurantsReservations":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","WheelchairAccessible":"True","HappyHour":"False","RestaurantsDelivery":"True"},"categories":"Restaurants, Mediterranean"},{"review_id":"K2-3wye990fMan4yrD359w","business_id":"76JM9BdE_XRzuYCVgZvcCA","stars_x":2.0,"date":1553750356000,"text":"Food was cheap and canned.

As other reviewers have stated, this \"restaurant\" is a small counter inside the Pan-Asia supermarket at Manchester and 141 (next to Academy).  The only reason I knew it was there was because I was searching for Ramen and Ramen Tei is closed on Tuesdays, so I was searching Yelp and Google for a replacement for my noodle fix.  I have never been in the supermarket and I really wanted to explore while waiting for my food.  We arrived at about 6 and the sign posted said they closed at 7 (different from Yelp that says 6:30).  We were a little cautious with our first order and ordered the #9 plain fried rice with beef and #17 Stir fried Egg noodles for the kids, and I ordered the #20 Beef Stew thick noodle soup.  The ordering process was pretty simple and I was asked to order by number, although be prepared that they do run out of things.  I tried to order the #16 beef chow fun but they were out, and diners after me were told that they ran out of fried rice, white rice, and some other items as we got closer to closing time.  The operation is not super slick, but you are getting good food from good people so be kind and be patient.  My food took a full 44 minutes from order to walking out, but I think part of the reason for the long wait is that they get very confused about who ordered what because they don't write order numbers or what the food is on the containers.  I think I saw my food walk out a couple of times with people who ordered after me, lol!  I think next time I may dine in becasue I think priority is given to dine-in orders and the dishes get less \"lost\" because they are in real dishes instead of stacked together in anonymous styrofoam and are brought to the table as soon as they are made. \n\nWhen we got home, we dug in and the food was very delicious and certainly worth a little wait.  The beef in the fried rice was lean and good quality and the rice was delicious (heavy on the bean sprouts which my daughter didn't love but were easily picked out).  The Stir fried egg noodles were a very thin noodle with big chunks of fluffy scrambled egg, plus some onion, carrot, and maybe bean sprouts.  They were very plain but great for kids and easy to dress up with condiments.  Also, when I say \"plain\", it still had better flavor than most noodles I have gotten at other places that just taste like soy sauce.   My beef stew was outstanding!  It had a very rich, dark broth that had a tiny bit of spiciness and I think was stewed with onion and mushroom, with a nice sheen that made me feel like it had been made with real beef with real fat that seeped into the broth.  I got a huge quart container full of that delicious broth and a huge clamshell full of fat noodles, with a small amount of bok choi, carrot, and some spring onion.  Not a lot of veg but a massive amount of food.  Put together, the broth and the noodles were perfection and I loved every bite!  Such an amazing soup and I am definitely getting it next time I am sick because I think it would cure me immediately!\n\nI can't wait to go back and try more things!  Everything I saw looked so delicious.  Maybe I'll call ahead next time or try to eat in.","name":"China Bistro","address":"14246 Manchester Rd","city":"Manchester","state":"MO","postal_code":"63011","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":35,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","HasTV":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': None, 'street': None, 'validated': None, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","Ambience":"{u'divey': False, u'hipster': None, u'casual': True, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': False, u'intimate': False, u'romantic': False, u'classy': False, u'upscale': False}","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","GoodForKids":"True"},"categories":"Restaurants, Chinese, Szechuan"},{"review_id":"-naOLaH-_bv_dg6njcK9AA","business_id":"97w1oemqGL_I-gchNIHZGw","stars_x":5.0,"date":1625694774000,"text":"Great spot for a nice family dinner.

Such a small and intimate restaurant with a great menu of authentic Chinese dishes. I would give it 5 stars but the food we had would be about a 4 and dying to go back and try more. \n\nWe ordered the soup dumplings, the squirrel fish, the ginger crab, and ice cream pot. The soup dumplings!!!!! Is such a must and actually one of the best I've had in the country. So flavorful and even ordered a second batch. They are so addicting and they pair it with the rice wine vinegar as well. Just writing this now, I am craving them!! They have a pork option and a crab one and both were so good. I think I liked the crab more but both equally as flavorful and so yummy. \n\nThe ginger crab is HUGE!!! And so freaking good. Seasoned and flavored so well and both left us stuffffed. Idk where they got these crabs but they were probably the size of my head and plenty of meat inside. It is definitely pricey but so worth. \n\nUnfortunately, the squirrel fish was a miss for us, which leaves me to write a 4 star review. we asked for the sauce on the side to not get the fish soggy, but the fish itself was quiet bland and the sauce was pretty subtle as well. It wasn't our favorite and probably will not order again. It is pretty pricey too so we wished we had gotten something else but it is presented in a unique way. \n\nBut overall, great date night spot. you MUST make a reservation so make sure you do before arriving! They only have about 4-6 tables in the restaurant to keep it intimate and fast service so it is understandable. Service was great and we really enjoyed ourselves.

Like the other reviews state, a reservation is required, and you will need to text in your full order prior to 4pm the day before your reservation based on the menus posted on the restaurant's Facebook page. (2 days' notice is required if you want the duck.) We knew nothing about plate sizes, so we ordered several items to make sure there was enough to eat. We had the entire restaurant to ourselves for the entire meal because there were no other reservations. Ordering in advance ensures the food is fresh and ready at the reservation time. They started bringing out the food at our reservationt time; I should mention that the waitress was very kind and kept our water filled without being overly attentive. She made sure we had a lot of time to just enjoy one another's company and the meal. We started off with the pork soup dumplings; we never had them before... I had to Google how to eat them correctly, honestly, but they were incredible! Our entrees came out next with a side of rice. My whole fried fish with sweet & sour sauce was incredible fresh, delicate, and was fried expertly; it was not the least bit greasy. My husband got the asparagus beef, and it was cooked perfectly with a sweet, flavorful sauce. We shared the Chinese broccoli stir fry, which was refeshingly bitter, which was a nice contrast to the slightly sweet sauce it was coated with. We also shared some mushroom soup that was served in a huge amount and piping hot. I was not as fond of the soup due to the very mild flavor, but my husband really enjoyed it. We will certainly be returning in the future to try more menu items.","name":"Private Kitchen","address":"8106 Olive Blvd","city":"University City","state":"MO","postal_code":"63130","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","Alcohol":"u'none'","WiFi":"u'no'","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","Ambience":"{'touristy': None, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': True, 'trendy': None, 'upscale': None, 'classy': None, 'casual': None}","RestaurantsTableService":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': None, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","NoiseLevel":"u'quiet'","OutdoorSeating":"False","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"3","GoodForKids":"False"},"categories":"Chinese, Restaurants, Shanghainese, American (Traditional)"},{"review_id":"6jYNSTkroTGHajX8wZyGaQ","business_id":"7kJ8YYlN2tku0GsfO_h-PA","stars_x":3.0,"date":1563146703000,"text":"The gyros are very good.

Here is a dish by dish breakdown (no pics cuz we devoured everything asap!): \n\n- Soup dumpling - 4.5\/5. Paper-thin wrapping, fragrant filling with the perfect amount of soup in each dumpling. They are bite-sized but those bites will be among the most delicious you'll ever take. \n\n- Lion head meatball - 3\/5. Generous amount of meat per serving, but tasted a little bland. Comes floating in a bowl of watery, flavorless broth.\n\n- Squirrel fish - 3.5\/5. Visually stunning, drizzled in sweet and sour sauce. It's a whole fish that's been flayed and cubed with all the meat still attached and then deep fried. Wasn't my cup o' tea (or cup o' fish) but it's certainly a crowd pleaser. \n\n- House beef in chef's sauce - 4\/5. Gorgeous plating with a tiny figurine of a bull. Sauce was deliciously savory with a hint of sweetness, but a little heavy-handed for my taste. After a few bites it started to get a little salty, but definitely worth trying. \n\n- Peking duck - 4\/5. Meat is well cooked, tender, with perfectly crisped skin. Served with steam buns, sliced scallions, and plum sauce to make your own little duck buns. This is really the highest rating I can bestow to Peking duck in the US, having eaten the real deal in Beijing which has forever ruined me. \n\n- Three ingredient vegetables - 3.5\/5. And FYI the 3 veggies are eggplant, bell pepper, and potato. Stir fried in a slightly spicy brown sauce, it's quite a tasty dish, but again just a tad salty. \n\n\nAt the risk of sounding repetitive, it is imperative that you text the phone number on their fb page ahead of time to not only reserve a table but also place your order. \n\nIt will be a struggle if no one in your group can speak\/text fluent Mandarin.

I browsed photos of their menu posted on their Facebook page and selected a couple of items I thought would be yummy. Then I texted 314-445-4605 to make a reservation.\n\nThere was some back and forth in terms of finalizing a time and then I sent them a message containing the menu items I wanted.\n\nOn the day of the meal, my girlfriend and I arrived  right on time for our reservation. A very nice lady wearing a mask led us to our table and got us some water. She then went out back and let the chef know that we had arrived. At that point we heard food getting fried and timers starting to go off in the kitchen. \n\nService started with some amazing soup dumplings, pork and crab! Pretty comparable to soup dumplings I've had in NYC. Make sure you get the dumplings. Order extra if you think you have the appetite for it. I'm literally planning on getting more of these dumplings the next time I'm in town.\n\nOnce we finished the dumplings, our waitress brought out our next set of dishes, Beef (fried) in Chef's Special Sauce and some Stir Fried Chinese Broccoli accompanied by some rice. These two dishes were really awesome. The beef was very crispy and retained a nice beefy flavor despite being fried. It was coated in a salty sweet brown sauce that went well with the rice. The broccoli wasn't overly fried and was very light, I definitely recommend this dish to bring some balance to the meal.\n\nAs my girlfriend and I were wrapping up our second course, the waitress brought out the Peking Duck that we ordered. I was looking forward to this since it required you to order it a day or two in advance. I was pleasantly surprised to see the duck accompanied by some duck wraps rather than buns. The duck was served two ways. The breast was thinly sliced for the wraps and this preparation was served with thinly sliced spring onions and cucumbers along with a plum or hoisin sauce. The rest of the duck was chopped up and could be eaten with rice (we had ordered their Yangzhou special fried rice to accompany this second style of duck. The fried rice was really yummy!). Overall the duck was decent for what you get in America but it wasn't a strong point of the meal. The meat could've been more flavored and the duck skin was lacking a strong crisp you'd expect from Peking duck. The preparation was beautiful though and if you need to feed a large group this might be a good dish to order.\n\nLastly, we finished up with ice cream served with a potted plant. It was basically strawberry yogurt and vanilla ice cream topped with a chocolate crumb and a flower so that it actually looks like a potted plant. This wasn't anything special but it was cute and I thought my girlfriend would like the novelty of it.\n\nOverall the food is really great and they didn't let that many customers in at once so it really felt like they were just dedicating the entire restaurant to us. It's a really special experience knowing that the chef is working hard solely for you. The service was good and it felt like a Chinese friend I never had, had invited me over so that their family could cook for me.","name":"Private Kitchen","address":"8106 Olive Blvd","city":"University City","state":"MO","postal_code":"63130","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","Alcohol":"u'none'","WiFi":"u'no'","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","Ambience":"{'touristy': None, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': True, 'trendy': None, 'upscale': None, 'classy': None, 'casual': None}","RestaurantsTableService":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': None, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","NoiseLevel":"u'quiet'","OutdoorSeating":"False","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"3","GoodForKids":"False"},"categories":"Chinese, Restaurants, Shanghainese, American (Traditional)"},{"review_id":"iPwmp4Kew0TAmDfuKJtHqA","business_id":"97w1oemqGL_I-gchNIHZGw","stars_x":5.0,"date":1634525510000,"text":"Atmosphere was nice and relaxing.

My boyfriend and I visited the Brentwood location on Sunday, 2\/15. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and unpretentious (which is important to me for a health-oriented business because that's not always the case). We bought 7 things to try, planning to take them for lunch a few days this week. Well, it's Wednesday and we have already eaten them because we've been making them for lunches and dinners. All of the options we've tried have been delicious - and so healthy. \n\nOne other thing I'll mention is that I'm not the hugest meat fan in general, and the thought of days old reheated meat kind of grosses me out. However, all of the meats have been very well-seasoned and moist, even reheated. I thought the meat may be a problem for me, but it's not at all.\n\nWhile the ~$10 per lunch price point is more than I might spend prepping my own meals, we all know I'll never actually prep my own meals and it's much cheaper and healthier than eating out for lunch every day. Also, they have a free rewards program where you get $5 off every $100 (or some variation of that)... basically 5% off.

But, doggone it, everything they serve is fresh, wonderfully seasoned, promptly made in front of you and tastes just great.\n\nChina Garden is adjacent to Rick's Ace Hardware, my home away from home for the past decade.  I like doing business with local firms so China Garden fits the bill.\n\nMy wife and I are finicky when it comes to sit down Chinese food with one or two favorites.  We ate at China Garden on evening almost by accident, both tired and leaving the hardware store, our car was parked in front of China Garden.\n\nThere are 4 or 5 small tables, the place is decorated in early American cardboard boxes and Chinese Calendars, and the menu is the place mat.\n\nIf there is a negative and it is a small one, is these folks are wonderful, but their grasp of English is limited.  I strongly suggest not ordering by phone, if you don't have the pre-printed menu.  If you do have the menu order by number, not by name of the dish.  I can understand how they could easily make a mistake on an order.\n\nI honestly did not expect much more than average, but both my wife and I were amazed at the quality of the food.\n\nHot and Sour Soup is a personal favorite, theirs is thick, spice and full of wonderful veggies, tofu, meat and mushrooms.  Just great and if you order it to go, a quart is less than $4.00.\n\nMy wife eats garlic chicken and I love General Tsao's, which is probably as authentic Chinese as Chop Suey.  I was shocked.  The portions are huge, the massive plate was surrounded by wonderful cooked brocolli that was crisp and bright green, and the entree wonderful.\n\nLike many of the storefronts they have a lower priced lunch menu.  Let me tell you, the price may be lower, but the food is just as fresh and well seasoned as dinner.  The portions are very, very generous.\n\nI hope the family that runs the China Garden does not read this review, they will discover that their prices are too low and they are too generous with their portions.\n\nUnlike the reviewer earlier, I have found the family to be very cordial and friendly, and will be a diner of theirs pretty much on a weekly basis.","name":"China Garden","address":"229 Lamp And Lantern Vlg","city":"Chesterfield","state":"MO","postal_code":"63017","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":44,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","WiFi":"'no'","BikeParking":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","OutdoorSeating":"False","Alcohol":"u'none'","HasTV":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"False","Caters":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","GoodForMeal":"{u'breakfast': False, u'brunch': None, u'lunch': None, u'dinner': True, u'latenight': None, u'dessert': False}","GoodForKids":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","Ambience":"{u'divey': False, u'hipster': False, u'casual': True, u'touristy': None, u'trendy': False, u'intimate': False, u'romantic': False, u'classy': False, u'upscale': False}","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': None, u'lot': None, u'validated': False}"},"categories":"Chinese, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"9C1k_H026U46qndBkTwTng","business_id":"JGVcrMpcaK6Wk0SEJLMx7w","stars_x":5.0,"date":1460226871000,"text":"I'm 56 and my younger days of working out and eating crap doesn't work anymore, didn't work well younger either.

The BEST to all!!\n\nI started eating these meals in February, 2016 after I moved here from Texas. \nSince I really don't like to cook..these meals were the answer to my food God!!!!!! :o)) Even my family knew I was in Fit-Flavors heaven!!!!!\n\nFrom April, 2016..I started to use these meals pretty much on a full time basis. I still make some of my own breakfasts...yet would rather have some of their yummy meals!!! The best part about all these meals (other than the great taste!)...they have all the nutritional information on each container. How much easier can that get??? \nI've always been into fitness and nutrition. However...Fit-Flavors just made things so much better. I lost weight and felt great! I still wanted to know more about how to fit these foods in with an even better nutritional plan.\n\nAbout a month ago, I attended a free Cooler Chat session with the Dietitian, Allison Leskow. The topic was MyFitnessPal. Since I've used MyFitnessPal in the past..I wanted to get more information about how to better use it. \nAllison was great! She was very informative and as so nice! I was then curious about having these foods and using this device. She said that she can help set up a nutrition program incorporating the Fit-Flavors food. That was my main focus...so I set up some sessions with her. Allison set up my program using calories, as opposed to my previous programs with the breakdowns of macros. Yet with these foods...that information is already there...and it is so much easier to just do calories.\n\nMy results were almost immediate and it's only gotten better!! It has been sooooo easy to stay focused and on track with MyFitnessPal!!! I'll also set up a few meals ahead and then I don't even have to think about what to eat other than look at the device to see what is planned for each meal and snack. And the body knows when it's time to eat!!!! Trust me!!!!!!\n\nI can honestly say that at the age of 66...this is the best I have ever looked or felt! My clothes fit amazing and I'm at the lowest size and weight I have been in a very long time and it is due to the right amount of calories for my body. And...I will not be on that yo-yo track anymore. This is a great way of life!\nAnd....eating these pre-made Fit-Flavors foods has been one the best things to make this journey so successful. And the snacks can be some of those \"forbidden\" foods...yet...when tracked...they fit right in with the plan. Even if I go out to dinner...it's still easy to track food with the device...so ya never have to be away from your plan.\n\nI cannot go on any further without saying...Allison is the reason for helping me get to this fantastic place in my life!!! She is the Best!!!!\nYes....I am the one to do the work. However..she is the one who gave me the correct tools and direction!\nI just love her and appreciate how much she cares about her clients! And no matter how many clients she has...you and your success are very important to her.\nI would encourage anyone who wants to make changes and have true success..to contact Allison!! It has been the best decision I have made in a very long time!!","name":"Fit-Flavors","address":"14842 Clayton Rd","city":"Chesterfield","state":"MO","postal_code":"63017","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":33,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","AcceptsInsurance":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","HappyHour":"False","DogsAllowed":"False","Alcohol":"u'none'","HasTV":"True","BusinessAcceptsBitcoin":"False","OutdoorSeating":"True","DriveThru":"True","ByAppointmentOnly":"False","WheelchairAccessible":"True","Caters":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"False","WiFi":"u'free'","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2"},"categories":"Food, Dietitians, Health Markets, Fast Food, Vegetarian, Health & Medical, Restaurants, Event Planning & Services, Caterers, Fruits & Veggies, Specialty Food, Nutritionists, Food Delivery Services, Gluten-Free"},{"review_id":"c4dSqCFLTsoxbLG6QMoxSw","business_id":"JGVcrMpcaK6Wk0SEJLMx7w","stars_x":5.0,"date":1570573505000,"text":"I love fit flavors.

Our food was served in styrofoam to-go boxes which made it easier to just eat what we wanted and be able to take the rest home for later.

We're visiting STL and took a gamble on this poke place we saw was open later than most restaurants in the area.\n\nFirst thing's first: portion size. The portions are enormous relative to what we're used to back at home, which is both a blessing and a curse. A large is truly -- large -- and should be reserved for those who are very hungry (which we were not, oops). It's difficult to notice the display with the sizes from the front of the shop (where orders are placed due to pandemic restrictions), so make sure you ask how big the sizes are before ordering.\n\nNext thing is the quality. We tried the salmon and the spicy tuna. The salmon was on par with the best we've ever tried, and the spicy tuna was pretty good and flavorful, but a little more \"loose\" than I'd like (likely due to a relatively high sauce\/tuna ratio in the spicy tuna recipe). The toppings were all fresh and high quality, and the sauces were also very good and not overpowering.\n\nNow to the criticisms: we were slightly disappointed by the rice, which was almost certainly not \"sushi rice\" as we were accustom to from other high quality shops, but instead plain white rice. In case you're curious, the difference between plain short grain white rice and \"sushi rice\" is the addition of a few key ingredients (like vinegar) to the former -- and it makes a massive difference. If this shop started to use sushi rice, I would be willing to bump it up half a star or more as everything else is quite high quality, and the only significant thing holding it back is the rice. The rice was also bland and a bit mushy, possibly from being slightly over cooked. The majority of a poke bowl is the rice, so I feel it was important for me to really dial in on what the rice was like.\n\nA final, more minor complaint was the takeout containers (froyo-style cylindrical paper containers) seemed a bit weird to put poke into, but maybe I'm being a bit too nitpicky here. High-moisture, steamy items like rice just don't seem as appetizing in this style of paper container. I would recommend some sort of recyclable clear plastic bowls, or really anything that is more bowl shaped.\n\nTL;DR: Work on your rice (make sushi rice instead of just using plain white rice) and your takeout containers, and you've got a real winner here.

I started doing orders with Fit-Flavors in February of this year. I wanted to get back into meal prepping and wanted to be mindful of low calorie\/low carb meals in order to lose weight, and stumbled upon Fit-Flavors. I like that the food is already prepared and only needs to be reheated in the microwave for minimal time. The prices aren't bad, about the same that you'd pay at a restaurant if not a little less, and on average in the $10-$13 range per person\/per meal. They offer free delivery for STL metro customers for orders over $70 or $75. That's easy to get to when you're buying meals for a whole week. You can also go to the store and pick up meals as you go and just put them in the freezer or heat them up that day. The food only lasts 5 days in the freezer.\n\nSome of the meals are hit or miss on flavor so there is a bit of trial and error that goes into finding what food you like, but most of the options are really tasty. My personal favorites are the spaghetti squash with marinara and meatballs, the buffalo chicken tenders\/nuggets, the Greek salad, blackened salmon, the oatmeal with mixed berries, and the steak with Yukon potatoes. My least favorite meal so far was the turkey meatloaf. The texture and taste just weren't it, at all. \n\nI also can proudly say that while doing Fit-Flavors for dinner only for 10 days out of a month (5 nights every other week), I did lose weight during those weeks, so I've been successful doing Fit-Flavors. If you're wanting to meal prep or just want to pick up dinner that is already portion controlled and has the nutrition facts of the entire meal indicated, I highly recommend Fit-Flavors!","name":"Fit-Flavors","address":"14842 Clayton Rd","city":"Chesterfield","state":"MO","postal_code":"63017","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":33,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","AcceptsInsurance":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","HappyHour":"False","DogsAllowed":"False","Alcohol":"u'none'","HasTV":"True","BusinessAcceptsBitcoin":"False","OutdoorSeating":"True","DriveThru":"True","ByAppointmentOnly":"False","WheelchairAccessible":"True","Caters":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"False","WiFi":"u'free'","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2"},"categories":"Food, Dietitians, Health Markets, Fast Food, Vegetarian, Health & Medical, Restaurants, Event Planning & Services, Caterers, Fruits & Veggies, Specialty Food, Nutritionists, Food Delivery Services, Gluten-Free"},{"review_id":"n0zk6iTZLabeJuzGAZx5sQ","business_id":"WLC8eW96Nm8a23nROVa7cQ","stars_x":5.0,"date":1607130660000,"text":"This is a really good Chinese option for East Coasters.

I am so super excited that we can finally get them here in St. Louis! \n\nIf you never tried, they are a hybrid of cake donuts and mochi, with a dense and chewy texture. Usually a sugar\/flavored glazed will be applied on one side of it. This week, they have Strawberry and Black Sesame and I love them both!!! Not quite as chewy as I would hope but it definitely meets my standard and every bite is so joyful\n\nThey have had Matcha, Taro, Cookies and Cream and powdered sugar flavors before.

A few minutes after placing an order I received a phone call confirming that I placed an order and the lady took my credit card over the phone. I live only 3 mins from the restaurant but chose delivery because I was being lazy ;) and from the time I hung up to when it was delivered was about 15-20 mins, so super quick in my opinion. The food was really tasty and plentiful for the price. I easily had enough leftover for another two-three meals. Hot and yummy. Since then I've ordered a few more times and have done both delivery and pick up and each time the process has been the same - easy ordering, quick delivery, yummy, hot and plentiful food. I've never eaten inside their restaurant but it's a pretty basic, nothing fancy strip mall joint and I've hardly ever had to wait a long time for my order - 10 mins or less if I don't preorder. They have a really extensive menu compared to others and though I tend to order the same several items, I haven't been disappointed yet.

I typically use the one that offers 4 free crab rangoon with an order over $12-$15.  I'm usually ordering two orders and that puts me just over the minimum amount and the crab rangoon is one of the best parts of this place, because they give you a good amount of filling and it is fried to a good amount of crisp.  \n\nWith your combination orders you get your choice of meat, fried rice, and an egg roll which you can usually substitute your choice of rice or crab rangoon if you'd like.  The meat\/rice combination is more than enough and makes for a decent 2nd meal.  \n\nIf you choose to eat in the establishment, there is plenty of seating and they offer free refills on your fountain drink if you get one, which is always nice.  The place is plenty clean for Chinese take-out and the person who takes your order speaks very good English, which can sometimes be tough at other places.

While you can still find their food around town at food truck rallies, the idea of it being so easily accessible on Manchester was the stuff dreams are made of!\n\nOrdering from Seoul Taco is so simple. Their online system is a breeze. We actually ordered inside with an incredibly pleasant employee though. The food was hot and ready in just a few minutes. (Ordering and getting fresh food is really something that I've missed during the pandemic.) Because it was a Friday in Lent, we went with completely meatless options. My boyfriend chose the tofu quesadilla and I went for the burrito (we had a coupon for a free taco too!) \n\nThe quesadilla was full of gooey cheese and oozed flavor. The rice in my burrito packed a spicy punch, but wasn't unenjoyable. Loved the fried rice inside the burrito, but would have liked there to be a little more sauce.

While waiting, you get a great view of the kitchen staff doing their stuff which doesn't give me much confidence in a great outcome.  2 stars for the lead up to dinner.\nCarbon Burrito (still have no idea what WHET includes) was very good but I was hungry so a shoe may have tasted fine.

Kid #2 had a  Carbon quesadilla which I finished off as leftovers the next day.  That was pretty tasty! For the actual food I'd give it 3.5 stars.

Not only is this probably the best fried chicken I've had in the States, but you'll be hard-pressed to find a better one in South Korea. Certainly lives up to the hype of St Louis' proud reputation as one of the best food cities in America.\n\nUpon entrance, it's a humble, clean interior. An added bonus for the bathrooms being clean and the sunlight beaming through helps you feel like you're getting a blessing of sorts, which is exactly what this place is.\n\nThe main event is of course the chicken itself-- the breading is extra crispy and light and allows the sauce to shine through. I got both the YumYum & spicy soy garlic. I'd recommend the latter as the spice factor seems a bit more prominent on it but the sauces were light, flavorful, and hit the sweet & savory notes we love to taste. I was pretty surprised to see that a LARGE drumstick(s) was included. Not only was the drumstick huge, but it was extremely flavorful as well. You can tell they've done something extra with it, perhaps a brining of sorts to help also get the poultry edge off of it too. I'm more of a wings\/flats guy but this drumstick was absolutely excellent. All in all an unforgettable experience. \n\nI got the ra-bap and Korean corndog too. I love me some black pepper in my fried rice and I love how they really lean into it. It's wonderfully seasoned and the cheese rounds out the flavors extremely well too. I've only made this at home for myself and  I personally make it with the noodles uncooked to give it a crunch, but the noodles are cooked through here. The corndog has a light coating of ketchup & sugar and the sausage is separately at the bottom while the corndog itself is stuffed with cheese.

We ordered a \"little\" of everything - ra-bap, rice crispy chicken, wings, and drumsticks (+ fries). First of all - THE PORTIONS!!! They are huge! We knew we would have leftovers but we will be eating on it all week! The drumsticks are very large and the wings are much bigger than what you'd get from a chain. Both were very flavorful and tender. The spicy soy flavor is not for the faint of heart - the heat builds up over time and you definitely need their vinegar-based slaw to cool off (comes with the combo). You also get fries with the combo meals, and they were surprisingly delicious! \nI have never had cheese with a Korean rice dish, so that was a nice surprise in the ra-bap. We did ask for a side of standard oy sauce for this dish. After eating the super flavorful wings, the rice dish just needed a little salt boost.\nThe crispy chicken tenders were very good! Crunchy and light! \n\nSome extra notes:\n-I believe they are still adjusting to dine-in service and are more used to supporting deliveries, but once we all got in the swing of things, everything was great and the server was awesome!\n-They don't have a liquor license yet and is BYOB for now.\n-There were 2 small TVs above the bar with NFL games on. There was a larger TV in the dining area, but it was playing music videos. I am not sure if that TV isn't able to get cable or if no one asked to change the channel.

I would definitely say penn station Philly cheesesteaks taste better. I noticed my green peppers looked almost raw and they would taste better cooked on a Philly.

The place was clean, pretty full, and really loud and rowdy. Noise just bounces from the floor to the ceiling, to the wooden tables\/chairs\/booths. I couldn't hear myself talking to my sister on the phone, who also said \"where are you because it's really loud?\" \n\nTo give a quick rundown of the food and my cocktail: the bourbon cocktail I had was excellent! The burger was trying to be on the same level of Shake Shack and doesn't compare. It was bland and basic. Read my experience below for more details on that. The fries are essentially McDonalds fries. Would you pay $13.75 to get McDonalds fries and a lesser version of Shake Shack burger? \n\nThe service was fair but friendly. My waitress suggested that I go with one of their regular menu burgers instead of the $6 Burger Week burger because she said it's really small. I was starving so I agreed. I ordered the King Burger with fries and a bourbon cocktail (the one with mint, simple syrup, and lemon juice, sorry I can't remember the name). \n\nI got my food really fast, like rocket speed, but it was missing onions which was noted on the menu and my waitress directly told me that \"raw onions\" come on the burger. I looked throughout my burger and found no onions. I flagged my waitress and told her. She apologized and said she'd go get some, and confirmed if I wanted raw or grilled onions. I replied that I wanted raw. She turns to walk away and 10 seconds later turns back saying that she thinks she sees them on the bottom of my burger. Honey, I've looked and there are none. She stood there and basically had me dissect my double patty burger, ripping the patties apart tearing the cheese up all to show her YET AGAIN, THAT THERE ARE NO ONIONS ON THE BURGER. She then walked away to go get them. Why did she come back less than a minute later with grilled onions saying \"I brought you grilled onions because they taste better.\" Ma'am, I asked for raw. I accepted the grilled, which legit tasted like White Castle onions. They did absolutely nothing for the burger, and I think the raw, as designated on the menu for this burger would have been a much better choice, which was my choice in fact, but I did not complain.\n\nBy this point, I was ready to go. They offer basic desserts including snowballs and ice cream, but my experience and the loud noise kept me from wanting to endure this experience any longer. The cocktail is the only redeeming value of my experience as it was exceptionally good, but everything else was subpar from other dining experiences in the near vicinity or greater metro area. This place seems to be confused on what it's trying to be. It has the appearance of a family friendly restaurant with its bright colors and cheerful demeanor, but with a bar, and with loud ambiance. It kind of seems like it's trying to be a kid-friendly sports bar and grill, which you can just do Applebee's, Buffalo Wild Wings, etc. for that. It's too much and not enough at the same time.","name":"The Parkmoor","address":"220 W Lockwood Ave","city":"Webster Groves","state":"MO","postal_code":"63119","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":46,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","RestaurantsTableService":"True","GoodForKids":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","WiFi":"u'free'","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","BYOB":"False","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","DogsAllowed":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","WheelchairAccessible":"True","Caters":"True","HasTV":"True"},"categories":"American (Traditional), Breakfast & Brunch, Burgers, Food, Desserts, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"8NBr7tY1Gw4flfmtyNpcQA","business_id":"_kvfdSVhVG4F0I3lNIbpaA","stars_x":5.0,"date":1623592782000,"text":"A family favorite!

The only thing that we wish that they had was more napkins at the table or some wet-naps\/wet-wipes to clean up your hands at the end.  They had some plastic finger covers, but we preferred to just dig in naturally and their tasty sauces like to stick on your hands. A tip is to order ahead if you're short on time.

I opted for a refund and informed her I would return the next day since I was already at home and had lost my appetite. The next day I returned to the restaurant and the female owner was quick to pull cash out of the register to hand me. Since I frequented this restaurant I trusted the female owner so I didn't even bother to check how much she handed me. I took a few steps away from the counter and so happened to find I was refunded for only 1 dish from my whole order. When I returned to the register I informed the female owner that I was not given the correct amount. She explained that she refunded me only for the dish that had the cigarette butt in it. I informed her that I wanted a full refund and that the whole order was untouched knowing the unsanitary prep\/handling of the food. The complete untouched food was in my vehicle and I asked if she would like to take it back. She did not want the food back and ended up refunding the whole amount. I was very disappointed w\/ how the female owner handled the situation and disgusted knowing that the cooks smoke while preparing the meals. I went back and forth with deciding whether or not I should review this establishment but I only find it fair that their customers should know to be aware of their unsanitary food prep.

Definitely a hit for our NYE crew. We ordered earlier in the day for pick up later that evening. They were so helpful to accommodate and called us as soon as it was ready for pick up. Great customer service! \n\nThe chicken itself was pretty good. We ordered the YumYum, Soy Garlic, and Honey Garlic wings and drumsticks. Having had Korean fried chicken in South Korea, the batter resembled the same light and airy texture. We placed the chicken on a rack in the oven to warm up and it still maintain its crunchiness. \n\nThe wings & Yum Yum sauce were the best! The YumYum sauce really stuck to the chicken, especially the wings! The legs were almost too big and I thought a bit dry. The dryness could have been due to it being take out and not eating right away. The other sauces (soy garlic and honey garlic) were good but just didn't have too much of a flavor difference. \n\nThe chicken also came with coleslaw and fries. The coleslaw was okay, but lacked flavor. The fries, however, were loved by all! They tasted great, and I popped them in the toaster oven. I was surprised by the maintained crispiness!\n\nOverall, pretty good based on the texture of the meat, fries, flavor and YumYum sauce. I also would love to try some other sauces and street food.

Worth a stop in.\n\nI've been to the Delmar location a bunch, but technically this new location is closer...by like a minute.  That's one less minute I have to wait to get that food in my belly!  This is the second time I've been to the new location on Chouteau.  So I'm going to combine.  Both times I ordered pickup on their website and both times I got the chicken burrito.  I always get the chicken burrito, why mess with perfection?!  The burrito is amazing.  It's huge, lil sweet, lil savory, lil spicy.  It's got kimchi fried rice, lettuce, cheese, shredded carrots, green onion, sour cream, and Seoul sauce (not sure what it is, but it rivals Boss sauce...if you know, you know).  I'm not a kimchi person but I really like how they do it, so don't let that sway you away if you're like me.  My total was about $10 and change.  The only difference between the two visits was the pickup process.  The first time, I showed up at my pickup time and everyone and their mother must have ordered at the same time.  They were running behind by about 15-20 minutes, which was apologetically communicated to me.  It was Friday night and I had nothing to rush off to, so I just popped back outside (because people are gross right now) and waited.  After about 15 minutes I went back in and they were still working on orders.  Total I think I waited about 25 minutes.  The staff were a bit frazzled, but they were still pleasant.  I would say this was a freak anomaly.  This time, I popped in early Sunday evening.  I was actually late, so everything was ready to go.  From the signage I could see, I didn't know what the pickup process was and I told the cashier that I had a pickup order and my name.  I felt like this annoyed the guy working the cashier.  To prevent you from making my error, walk in on the Manchester side, bypass the cashier area and go to the back where you see a line of tables.  They do the pickup orders back there.  The guy back there was very nice and I walked out and went home to gorge myself.

They had Super Bowl special and we got a whole for the price of a half. Very friendly and it took about ten minutes. There is no real seating and we wanted it hot so we ate I. The car so I couldn't take a picture. It was awesome, savory and no chewy pieces. My wife raved about it and I thought it was very good.

Located in S. City near Carondolet Park in what used to be a small Italian restaurant. \n\nThe menu is limited and focused on one thing - CHICKEN. Bone in wings, drumsticks, breasts, or boneless bites. I went boneless. The chicken itself was fresh and fried perfectly. OG KFC traditionally uses rice flour to make sure it's extra crispy. I believe that is the case here. Served with lemon seasoned fries and a green cabbage slaw with canned corn and a lightly spicy Mayo based dressing. Small meal was priced reasonably at $15 for a portion that could easily serve 2. \n\nThe sauces - The OG YumYum sauce was sweet with a hint of black pepper. Definitely recommend! The spicy soy garlic was too spicy in my opinion - I like spicy food but the 9 of 10 spice level wasn't what I was expecting. \n\nWith amazing chicken, why not 5 stars? I wish they had more sides to compliment the chicken. The chicken itself was 5 stars but the menu felt like a limited pop up menu. I would like some different kimchi's or even just a cucumber salad to add on to cool down the spice. \n\nAtmosphere and decor- Super clean restaurant. The bar area looks cool, however, overall the restaurant decor felt like it lacked originality. Props for the little kid's drawing on the wall. Plenty of table seating. Music \"radio\" on the TV - similar to \"music choice\" if you know what I mean. \n\nBooze? No alcohol served at the bar but I believe you can byob or wine in. Will call ahead to inquire next time if I bring others. A beer would go great with the menu.\n\nService- I ordered takeout from the bar and good service from my server. The chef brought me my order himself. Very friendly staff. They are smart to cut holes in the to-go container so the chicken doesn't steam itself and lose crispiness. Due to the holes in the container the smell will get you chicken drunk if you drive home with an order. \n\nOverall, 3.5 - 4 stars, leaning towards 4. Chicken 7 is good but they have a little bit of work to do.

My visit for lunch today was therefore not an exercise in nostalgia, but a search for a clean, comfortable, casual, friendly and reasonably priced restaurant serving what has come to be called \"comfort food\" - great hamburgers, sandwiches, salads, etc.  \nThe Parkmoor certainly checks all the boxes on the first three factors - clean, yes (although some of the servers masks failed to cover noses or mouths); casual (yes, with colorful but somewhat plain looking wooden chairs, tables and booths inside); and service was efficient and friendly, certainly as to our personable waitress and the waiter we frequently overheard.\nReasonably priced?  Well, I'll give them that too, as while prices seemed a touch high on the menu, portions were fairly large and many patrons, ourselves included, took home a loaded to-go box from the tall and long entrees (e.g., a fried baloney sandwich served on two grilled cheese sandwiches).\nBut great comfort food?  Sorry, not to my taste.  Mediocre or average at best, to be kind. \nThe Philly cheesesteak, described on the menu as \"slow roasted beef griddled with green peppers, caramelized onions, giardiniera (pickled vegetables), finished with melted provolone and liquid gold cheese sauce\" was seemingly composed of Arby's roast beef with few green pepper fragment, no onions (but instead a bevy of garlic cloves - same color?), three slivers of pickled carrots (which ain't giardiniera in Chicago or Philly, as far as I know) with two slices of provolone and a cheese sauce not unlike the radioactive, non-perishable cheese sauce often found on movie or sporting event nachos.  I derived little true comfort from this cheesesteak.  (P.S. - fries were very salty and not very hot.)\nMy advice - go for the nostalgia, but ... eat the entrees only if you need to invoke the good ole memories.

When I finally got the chance to visit for a to-go lunch, I was blown away!\n\nOrdering my lunch was super simple through their website. I perused the menu, made me selections and drove to pick it up. So simple! The Chicken Seven location is a small building in South City, but is easy to find because it's painted bright yellow. My food was ready as soon as I walked in. The worker behind the bar was super friendly during our brief interaction while I picked up my lunch.\n\nI'll say... I definitely over ordered! Chicken Seven serves up hearty portions. So keep that in mind while you're ordering. The first thing I ordered was the Tteokbokki. This bowl of pepper sauce was covered in flavorful, gooey cheese. The thing I loved even more about it was Korean rice cakes swimming around this tasty dish. They were delightfully chewy and made the dish a filling meal. I was obsessed with the rice krispee chicken! These bites were flavorful and tender. So juicy. And the best part were the crunchy cereal crisps on the chicken bites. Not sure what sauce was served with the chicken but it was SO yummy.\n\nCan't wait to visit Chicken Seven for a sit down meal!","name":"Chicken Seven","address":"6312 S Grand Blvd","city":"St. Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63111","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":25,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","HasTV":"True","WheelchairAccessible":"True","OutdoorSeating":"False","GoodForKids":"True","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': True, u'lot': False, u'validated': False}","RestaurantsTableService":"True","Caters":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"True"},"categories":"Restaurants, Korean, Chicken Wings"},{"review_id":"2PcO-MBL303HwbSCxLHttQ","business_id":"Zh_ehXDxXNtjwE1AA_dAoQ","stars_x":1.0,"date":1632527794000,"text":"Tried placing a take out order at 6:30pm but was placed on \"hold\".

My former coworker, Lucas, and I like to periodically catch up over lunch. We usually have to meet in Webster Groves as it is kind of the middle point between his new office and my (home) office. The Parkmoor's bold presence on the web definitely sets it apart from other lunch spots and caught our interest for one of our lunchtime pow-wows. \n\nFinding the The Parkmoor is super simple. It's located on the bustling business district portion of Lockwood. I easily found on street parking, but had to dodge a few cars going a tad too fast for such a pedestrian heavy locale. \n\nThe retro interior of The Parkmoor is so engaging. Bold colors. Strong lines. And a subtle sports theme. The restaurant had a vibrant energy that lent itself to a jovial meeting with Lucas! Additionally, our waitress was such a gem. She was polite and not pushy. Definitely added to the feel-good vibes of The Parkmoor. \n\nI will be the first to admit that I'm not the biggest burger person. They're fine. I just never get excited about them. EEEEEEESpecially when they're served on brioche. Ok. So I hate brioche buns. It is objectively the actual worst bread out there. Dryer than saltines. For YEARS I've voiced my displeasure with restaurants touting this garbage excuse of a carb as a high end bread. It's trash. stop using it everywhere. Please. I was a bit bummed that the menu at The Parkmoor didn't clearly identify the bun as brioche, but simply a buttered bun. Had I known I would have ordered something else. But I made it work. Slather enough ketchup on a brioche bun and it'll pass. The actual flavors of my mushroom swiss burger were really good. The mushrooms were tender and added a little extra heft to the smash patties.\n\nSince this lunch was pre-2022 and I wasn't really paying attention to what I was eating, I started the meal with a bowl of their gumbo. The bowl was massive and definitely enough for a meal! I appreciated the selection of hot sauces The Parkmoor offered. I would absolutely get the gumbo again.\n\nExcited to visit The Parkmoor again during the summer to try one of their New Orleans style sno cones. The photos make them look like the perfect summer treat. Especially because you can add a little booze to them to get your night started.","name":"The Parkmoor","address":"220 W Lockwood Ave","city":"Webster Groves","state":"MO","postal_code":"63119","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":46,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","RestaurantsTableService":"True","GoodForKids":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","WiFi":"u'free'","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","BYOB":"False","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","DogsAllowed":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","WheelchairAccessible":"True","Caters":"True","HasTV":"True"},"categories":"American (Traditional), Breakfast & Brunch, Burgers, Food, Desserts, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"AGqpKyneWcx7w-RkUz9uVQ","business_id":"_kvfdSVhVG4F0I3lNIbpaA","stars_x":5.0,"date":1642190307000,"text":"I remember going to The Parkmoor in Clayton with my mom as a kid.

Actually walked out of here on a Friday night after sitting at a table for 35 minutes without being served or acknowledged by any of the staff. My fiance got a drink from the bar and asked for a menu after about 15 minutes of waiting. We finished our drinks, waited a few more minutes, paid our tab at the bar then left.

Regardless, I don't like ho's\/hoes; they annoy me because they think I'm really that shallow to tip them more than normal because of their big boobs\/ exposed thong\/ pierced belly button. Show me a place with ho's, and I'll show you a place without me (I know--its inversely related to \"College Me.\"). \n\nAnyway, so I finally take the step, literally, into D's Place, and what do you know? No ho's\/hoes! In fact, there were no servers at all!\n\nWhen we walked in three guys said hi to us--and not like, \"what's up, fellow bar patron,\" but more like \"hello, and welcome to D's.\" I thought the first two were employees, so I was going to ask if there were servers, or if we simply went up to the bar--but then they left. When the third came by our table and saluted us in the same manner, I simply ignored him, thinking he too was just another customer, but then he asked us if we'd been helped. \n\nJesus, I suck at this game. \n\nSo the waitress\/bartender finally comes over for our order--which takes forever to get, and when we asked for menus, she brought them over and didn't come back for 15 minutes. Redonkulous. \n\nAnyway, the most important thing: drinks here--that is, domestic beer and well drinks--are ALWAYS $2. And these aren't served in rocks glasses (for the drinks), they're served in PINT glasses. Also, for you bartenders\/drunks out there, its not a tall, its an actual double pour pint glass. \n\nSo, to recap: crappy service (at least on a Wednesday evening), $2 Big Boy cocktails.

They include butter, sour cream and steak sauce, as well as a plastic dinnerware\/napkin packet (but I go home and use real silverware).\n\nAs far as I can tell, the steaks are cooked fresh and to order, and they're quite nice. I've had the t-bone dinner and the slightly less expensive ribeye. They're of reasonably good quality, very flavorful, tender ... nothing to complain about at all there.\n\nThese dinners come with a side baked potato, a slice of bread (optimistically described as Texas toast), and a small salad. Everything's good; the potato and bread could be larger, but for the price, once again, I can't complain. At least not much. That's probably the difference between 4 and 5 stars.\n\nI haven't eaten a whole gyro, just sampled my significant other's a couple of times, but they're definitely worth the price -- if I craved a gyro I'd go there unless I just happened to be closer to Majestic in the Central West End or  Olympia on McCausland just south of I-40, my other two go-to spots for that kind of thing.\n\nI haven't tried the wings. They serve two styles, Miami (i.e. naked) and Chicago (battered), and have some nice price specials for large quantities.\n\nThe service is fast and friendly, and when I've called ahead they've been courteous, they've gotten the order right, and they've had it ready when we arrived (it's an 8 or 9 minute drive from home).\n\nRecommended.","name":"Miami Grill","address":"7101 Page Ave","city":"Saint Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63136","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":31,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Caters":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': True}","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"False","OutdoorSeating":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"False","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","BikeParking":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","NoiseLevel":"'average'","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","WiFi":"'no'","GoodForKids":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","Alcohol":"u'none'","BYOB":"False","HasTV":"False","RestaurantsTableService":"False","RestaurantsDelivery":"True"},"categories":"Greek, Food, Chicken Wings, Steakhouses, Restaurants, Desserts"},{"review_id":"kNgd72GT2gaPIsoCtU8GTg","business_id":"aePpEsIT6LzGuNDjS5U0Ag","stars_x":5.0,"date":1430165732000,"text":"Great place!!!

The proof was as I sat at the bar enjoying my lunch, all the other patrons greeted each other by name. That's a true neighborhood bar. \n\nMy biggest dilemma was should I order wings or a burger. After getting recommendation from the bartender, I choose to go wings. Especially after I found out, I could choose two different flavors in one order. I went with my favorite, Lemon & Pepper and a bar favorite, Garlic Parmesan.\n\nWhen ordering wings, I am a stickler for my order having the same amount of flats and drums. D's impressed me, they not only gave me the same amount of flats and drums in my order, they also made sure each flavor had the same amount. \n\nMy wing pieces were good in size and fried to a crispy crunch. Being a true fan of Lemon & Pepper, it was my favorite. I love the tang of lemon and kick of pepper. I can see why their Garlic & Parmesan is a bar favorite. However, I would not recommend them on a date night. I say that with a smile, because they're garlic flavor as good as it was, it was strong. I guess if you share the order, with your date all would be good. (smile)\n\nI was not impressed with the fries that I had as a side with my wings. I'm super picky about my fries and don't care for the type that are seasonally coated. I heard their onion rings are good, so when I come back to experience the, Hell Fire Burger that has fried jalape\u00c3\u00b1os on it (another favorite of mine) I'll order onion rings as my side. \n\nService was dive bar friendly. The bartender called all the other guest by their name. Not knowing mine, she just called me, \"Babe\" when she checked on me frequently. With only a single bartender covering the entire bar and tables, the service was attentive. \n\nI'll be back? - Hell Fire Burger is calling my name. \n\nWhen: September 11, 2019\nWhy: 9-4-19 ROTD on Yelp","name":"D's Place","address":"900 Barton St","city":"Saint Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63104","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":49,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","WiFi":"u'free'","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","GoodForKids":"False","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': True, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BusinessAcceptsBitcoin":"False","NoiseLevel":"'average'","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","OutdoorSeating":"True","HasTV":"True","Caters":"False","HappyHour":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': True, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"},"categories":"Burgers, Bars, American (Traditional), Nightlife, Pizza, Chicken Wings, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"ArpGQ6XIeT-yEUqm0N4pug","business_id":"aePpEsIT6LzGuNDjS5U0Ag","stars_x":1.0,"date":1583110408000,"text":"A fantastic pub with great folks but I still ask why they felt they needed to bring an army to cast out a 30 year Marine.

Everytime we would pass, the aroma emanating from inside was far superior to what this neighborhood watering hole looks like on the outside.  I guess like they say, never judge a book by its cover! \n\nWe are trying our best to support the local bars and restaurants in our new neighborhood as the lucrative summer months wane. Picking up a to go meal is such an easy way to help businesses in the area survive. Since we didn't have plans for dinner, I suggested trying D's. \n\nI'm giving D's a four star rating because of customer service. When I called in to place my order, the employee was very grumpy and not helpful. I simply asked how many slices were in a 10-inch pizza. (We were having a friend over for dinner as well, so I wanted to make sure we had plenty.) Because this was my first ever time trying D's food, I had no context of size or slice count. The person on the other side of the telephone threw me a little attitude saying \"it's square cut. I don't know how many pieces it makes.\" Well then. Just the info about it being square cut slices was enough to give me an idea of how much I needed to offer. I would give D's a three because of the worker's curtness with me, but actually in these type of situations, it makes the Soulard bar feel more authentic. So hey. Great work creating a real dive bar vibe! (But maybe be a little nicer.)\n\nThe menu is pretty on par for what you'd expect for a local bar. Standard items like salads, wings, and sandwiches. I did appreciate the interesting specialty pizzas. When you have thin crust pizza, you might as well dress it up with something exotic! We took the gamble on the Spicy Special, described as Hot sauce, bacon, hamburger & cheddar jack cheese. I impulse bought the Cheesesteak pizza because it just sounded interesting with Pizza sauce topped with saut\u00c3\u00a9ed roast beef, onion, green pepper and pizza cheese. Both pizzas had a lot of flavor. The crust was crunchy with an every so slight doughy texture. And they were even better cold the next day.

My first time there the waitress I believe her name was Jessica super nice to us gave some great suggestions for food and always followed up during a busy happy hour time. Everything we had was super fresh and tasted well. The buffalo chicken wontons are a must and if you're in a crowd you might want to order more than one appetizer! The white pizza actually comes with chicken on it see if you can substitute chicken for sausage. I added sausage to it but I think it would've liked it better without chicken either way it was good. Fried pickle chips are perfect and the crust stays on them pretty good unlike other places. The burger we ordered was a little dry so maybe next time order a medium to make sure they don't over cook it. However this would not stop me from returning.  I do look forward to enjoying their patio during the war months because the only downside is the dining room side is extremely loud and it's hard to talk\/hear even when you're next to someone. I'm hoping to also try the bar side of the pub next time hoping it's not as loud. It definitely has a local vibe but like I said the waitress was very welcoming and everybody seem like they were just having a great time without any snobbery ... that's what makes Sue lard so great.

I love the specials at D's because it makes me want to spend more money there time and time again.\n\nYesterday I wanted to catch the Cards game since Chris Carpenter was making his season debut after missing most of the season.  It seemed like a good time to celebrate, despite the final outcome of the game.  D's Place offers half price pizzas, any pizza, during Cardinal games.  I ordered a large specialty pizza for $7.50.  I ate what I wanted while washing it down with two dollar domestics and took the rest home to share with my wife when she got home.\n\nI had the D's Spicy Special: hamburger, bacon, jack cheese, and hot sauce, coupled with a side of ranch for dipping.  I'm not big on hot sauce, but with ranch, it makes for a nice pub snack.  Really I had my wife in mind; otherwise, I would have ordered a meat or chicken pizza.  Either way, I was pretty content.\n\nD's has its few drawback.  First, it draws a lot of middle-aged men. I think the bartender appreciated me for not being an old creeper!  I was there for the game, not to be flirty and gross.  Also, it allows smoking, which, despite the new law, I think is completely okay.  Owners should not be forced to be non-smoking.

We came nearing the end of November because I HAD TO HAVE those pumpkin pancakes before they weren't on the menu anymore. \n\nWhen we arrived we waited more than 5 minutes for an employee to acknowledge us or the couple of people waiting to pay. This did not start the visit off well - especially since multiple employees had come by the area but none of them acknowledged us or the others waiting to pay. If I had not already been here before with amazing service, I would have left before they did acknowledge us and seat us. \n\nOur server was nice and let me know they did still have the pumpkin pancakes (they were not on the menu). She made some recommendations to Hubby as he was undecided. When the pancakes came out, they did not taste like the last time I had them and I was disappointed - they were very thick and heavy. I ate them and just went with it. Overall none of the food was hot - even the coffee was only warm. That was unusual. \n\nAfter getting the bill and going to pay I noticed that it said pancake full order on my receipt. I would have preferred knowing there were options when I ordered as I did not need the large size I received. \n\nOverall the visit was disappointing and not the same service, food or experience I had during the Elite event.","name":"Sunny Street Cafe","address":"11692 Manchester Rd","city":"Des Peres","state":"MO","postal_code":"63131","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":46,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","Alcohol":"u'none'","RestaurantsReservations":"False","WheelchairAccessible":"True","WiFi":"u'free'","OutdoorSeating":"True","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","BYOB":"False","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': None, 'validated': False, 'lot': None, 'valet': False}","BikeParking":"True","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': None, 'romantic': None, 'divey': False, 'intimate': None, 'trendy': True, 'upscale': None, 'classy': None, 'casual': True}","Caters":"True","Corkage":"False","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","RestaurantsDelivery":"None"},"categories":"American (New), Breakfast & Brunch, Coffee & Tea, Food, Tex-Mex, Cafes, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"ezTcfw5VsNcdpqlqcJosKQ","business_id":"H_T1u5hL5HwH-XR9oZqYYg","stars_x":4.0,"date":1581365949000,"text":"Good food and plenty of it!

You might find some of the nearby street names familiar, if like me you regularly check the crime reports in the Post-Dispatch \"for your own personal amusement.\" The street directly adjacent to it is one way, but it's impossible to tell which way that is, because the sign is broken. If you get caught driving down it either way, you'll probably get charged out the ass by one of these corrupt North County municipalities where the mayor drives a Cadillac with personalized plates, and everyone in his family pulls down a six figure salary from the city (and yet they all still live in Pine Lawn), including his umpteen baby's mothers. Across the street is the world's sketchiest no tell motel a\/k\/a sleep n fuck. Next door is the world's sketchiest car dealership. Directly behind the Miami Grill is a small tenement building or duplex where a group of guys stands out front at all hours of the day and night (but maybe just to get some fresh air).\n\nWhat they serve: Chicken wings. It's actually listed as both a steakhouse and a place to get chicken wings, and it's worth noting that they take their status as a steakhouse seriously (despite themselves). On the west side of the building, there's a big-ass picture of a steak dinner. It says you can get a t-bone steak dinner there for $10. The sign out front lists steak first and foremost, along with chicken wings, fish, shrimp, phillies and gyros. If you call them on the phone and ask them what they serve (srsly), they mention the t-bone dinner, the rib eye dinner, the chicken wings and then a few other things. I've been there a million times and mostly just got the chicken wings. I did try the $10 t-bone dinner once, out of morbid curiosity, and it wasn't half that bad. It falls somewhere in between that steak you would get on Steak Night in the cafeteria in college and a steak dinner it would cost you like $13 to make for yourself. It's the Kindle Fire of steak dinners: Anyone who would actually buy one shouldn't be allowed to complain. Not just about steak dinners - about anything. LOL\n\nWhich kind of wings you should get, Miami or Chicago: Chicago. This is essentially a choice between a \"naked\" wing (Miami) and a breaded wing (Chicago, duh), with the caveat that I'm not sure if the Miami wing is just a raw chicken wing dipped in hot oil and sprinkled with some sort of seasoning. The skin is a deep, dark brown, almost black, and I'm not sure why exactly. I would compare the taste to those Tyson Foods tequila lime chicken wings, but not disgusting. The breading on the Chicago-style wings bears an eery similarity to the shit they use to bread the fish. It's relatively light and thin for fried chicken skin a\/k\/a the black man's kryptonite, but it's not too mealy, and it'll run you about half as much as the wings at, say, Popeyes, two doors down. It has a nice crispness that holds up to a requisite liberal dousing with hot sauce, which is supplied in its own mini celebrity hot tub. I recommend just dumping the entire thing onto your wings. If you accidentally get some on your fries and the two pieces of white bread they give you (this being a hood joint and all), consider that an added bonus.","name":"Miami Grill","address":"7101 Page Ave","city":"Saint Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63136","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":31,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Caters":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': True}","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"False","OutdoorSeating":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"False","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","BikeParking":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","NoiseLevel":"'average'","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","WiFi":"'no'","GoodForKids":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","Alcohol":"u'none'","BYOB":"False","HasTV":"False","RestaurantsTableService":"False","RestaurantsDelivery":"True"},"categories":"Greek, Food, Chicken Wings, Steakhouses, Restaurants, Desserts"},{"review_id":"YqEFHflGOsbinrGoRH6POw","business_id":"uMjfvnKnxdgrjHym-JKRYQ","stars_x":1.0,"date":1627523808000,"text":"I typically like their food, but my last occasion was not good at all.

I don't mean that it just wasn't extra spicy as requested, but it wasn't the least bit spicy AT ALL! As far as I'm concerned it was just chicken in a sauce whose flavor I couldn't quite put my finger on.\n\nNow, the egg drop soup. Always been a favorite of mine. But it was extra thick and the taste wasn't quite right. Even my super nice manager, who said his sweet and sour shrimp was great, said that the soup \"tastes like soap.\"\n\nConsidering how many Chinese delivery places there are, I'd try some other places before ordering from this one again.","name":"Hsu's Hunan Yu","address":"11539 Gravois Rd","city":"Saint Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63126","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","GoodForKids":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","OutdoorSeating":"False","WiFi":"u'no'","Caters":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"False","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","Alcohol":"u'none'","HasTV":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': None, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsReservations":"False","RestaurantsTableService":"True","Ambience":"{'touristy': None, 'hipster': None, 'romantic': None, 'divey': None, 'intimate': None, 'trendy': None, 'upscale': None, 'classy': None, 'casual': True}"},"categories":"Chinese, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"KZ7SSTUZ-i3fRzxDKaT6jQ","business_id":"Cq3pmXsd5k4Z9zPlYkTvxQ","stars_x":2.0,"date":1531178334000,"text":"Had delivery for the first time.

My normal Chinese restaurant did not have a driver this evening and I was tied up doing things around the house so I decided to branch out and try somewhere different. The online ordering was convenient and the driver was nice and the food arrived on time and hot. If I was rating on convenience they'd get all five stars, but my review is based on the food.\n\nI ordered shrimp egg foo yung with fried rice and crab Rangoon. The fried rice was still white, not even tan... the fried rice I am accustomed to is at least tan if not a nice brown color. It was incredibly bland and looked unappetizing. The egg foo young itself wasn't bad at all, but the gravy that comes with it had cinnamon in it, which was not a pleasing twist on the staple recipe, and the shrimp- while there was a generous amount- was overcooked and rubbery. The crab Rangoon were also disappointing, they didn't have much flavor or filling. \n\nI would probably give a second chance and try something different- no fried rice or crab Rangoon and no shrimp- but I would only try again in a pinch because of the convenience.

It's on the more costly end of fast food restaurants, but the taste of the chicken far outstrips other fast food places, and even most sit-down restaurants! Their chicken is not over processed chicken product, but great cuts of real chicken breast, lightly but flavorfully breaded & juicy (Now I'm hungry). They also have some of the BEST lemonade and when I used to work nearby, I would often take home a gallon jug to keep at home (just be on the lookout for seeds, this is the real deal). Also, (a college friend turned me on to this), mix the honey mustard with a packet of mayo to dip the waffle fries in...it's life affirmingly good. They also serve breakfast, but I have yet to try it as they don't have one close to my home (almost a reason to move).\n\nThey are closed on Sunday so their workers can have the day to devote to their families and the Lord. While this can be disappointing when I'm out on a Sunday, I respect that they're not only standing by their beliefs, but also making sure their employees can have a decent family life.

However, the overall experience made it deserving of a two-star review.\n\nHsu's Hunan Yu is located in a small strip mall, parking itself is limited, and the inside is small however there is enough room for four booths for seating. I would likely encourage another option than dining in because they had a portable space heater that felt like the fire of Hades had expanded into the dining area, making the experience uncomfortable. I feel that carry out and delivery is what keeps this place in business. \n\nWhen we first arrived, we were greeted with a less than enthusiastic how can I help you, which wouldn't have been an issue on its own but it likely signaled the start of a downhill dining experience. After ordering, we grabbed a table and waited, and continued to observe the employee who seemed to become annoyed any time the phone rang. On one occasion we overheard the employee venting and swearing in the back. Apparently, a customer had called in, and they didn't have their order, he repeatedly told the customer that they had to have called the wrong restaurant, only to discover after hanging up that the order was placed online and took time to process. The highlight of my visit had to be when I overheard the employee storm into the back and yell, \"Call me when's delivery comes in, I don't want to be here all fucking day\". \n\nAs far as my food goes, the hot braised pork seems to have more breading than actual pork, but the sauce was tasty as was the rice.

It took an abnormally long amount of time for someone to acknowledge me & then a while to get my food order placed, especially when the bar area didn't have many people seated. \n\nI'd give it another shot, but am disappointed in the lack of service I had while I was there.","name":"Sports & Social STL","address":"651 Clark Ave","city":"St. Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63102","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":22,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsDelivery":"True","HasTV":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","BestNights":"{u'monday': False, u'tuesday': False, u'wednesday': False, u'thursday': False, u'friday': False, u'saturday': False, u'sunday': False}"},"categories":"Restaurants, Nightlife, American (Traditional), Bars, Sports Bars"},{"review_id":"E7wuxFqrl92ja6bkeM2yWQ","business_id":"Cq3pmXsd5k4Z9zPlYkTvxQ","stars_x":4.0,"date":1600978865000,"text":"This place is close and has been my go to spot since moving into the area.

Not a typo...but a little like Christmas in July.  \nJust open for 2 1\/2 months, this little gem should be on your list for street tacos.  Amazing!  \nWife works the register at the front (where you place your order or call it in for pick up or curbside service), husband works in the back making street tacos and sandwiches.  There are four tables, seat yourself, so that's an option too. Service was outstanding...friendly, helpful, order ready in record time. I can only comment here on the tacos and will probably never make a change in the future to their sandwiches because tacos are just that good.  \nSo back to my opening comment...without the proper seasoning, most food never makes it to that next level of flavor.  Well it sure does here.  Everything from the cebollitas (fried green onions - be sure to try) to the tacos (carne asada, al pastor and daily special when I went...champechanos) were truly delicious.  There were many more taco options, some of which I will be trying soon...maybe not the cow tongue but hey, there is something for everyone.  Onions and cilantro are options on all tacos which are all made with corn tortillas...tortillas that didn't break even by the time we got our carry out home.  \nYou might be thinking...where are the mouth watering pictures?  Well, that was my plan until I saw my neighbor eating here who had to return after eating here just yesterday.
