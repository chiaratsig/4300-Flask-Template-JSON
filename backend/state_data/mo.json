If you don't look closely, you are sure to pass it up because it is tucked away in a quiet neighborhood.\n\nAtmosphere: This was one of my favorite things that I noticed about the coffee shop. It is full of warm, positive messages from patrons as well as positive slogans hanging on the walls. A nice selection of couches and artsy tables to choose from. It felt like walking into a home which made the environment wonderful to work in. I felt a sense of calmness while sitting down which was something I hadn't felt in a long time when getting to work.\n\nCoffee - I have a tendency to just get my go-to favorite of a caramel latte with extra caramel, but I decided to go with the special which was the Honey Vanilla Lavender. You could taste each flavor individually which I appreciated it and the lavender wasn't overpowering.\n\nA bonus: It came in an adorable mug that you would find in your kitchen which made the experience homier. I love it when coffee shops veer away from the basic clean cut cups of just solid colors\n\nService: Everyone was helpful and kind and assisted me with navigating through the menu. Patience is something I appreciate it when I arrive at a new place. It makes the experience all the better. Also, they have a point system that stays in house which makes me happy because I won't lose it as I have with other places lol\n\nOverall, I may have found my new place to work and write. The environment and the coffee is something to experience. If you are over near the macklind area, go over to Espresso Yourself.

There is seating inside and outside, and you'll often see someone who must've stopped by while walking their dog or going for a daily walk just chilling with a drink at an outside table.\n\nBased upon their great array of specialty lattes, I would say that their focus is more on the casual, not particularly pretentious coffee drinkers. Which to me is fine, since St Louis has plenty of the more pretentious coffee shops.\n\nThe only knock on this place is that because it is in a neighborhood, parking is limited and on the street. Usually if I stop by early, it's not an issue. But it is something to keep in mind.\n\nOverall, I definitely recommend this place.

Upon walking in the woman behind the counter was UNBELIEVABLY rude. No smile, no hello, and a HORRIBLE attitude. I'm almost 40 years old, have lived all over the country, overseas, traveled the world, and can honestly say I've NEVER experienced such complete rudeness when trying to purchase something from someone. I grew up in this neighborhood, frequented this place prior to it being Bellos, and recently moved back with my husband and children. I was excited to come back in and have cookies made for my son's birthday, but couldn't even follow through with the order because I was so ASTONISHED by this woman's attitude. I do want to be clear that this woman had long black hair, piercings and tattoos (Though you can't always see them, I too have piercings and tattoos so let me be clear that this was NOT the issue). I'm clarifying because I would imagine that there are some very courteous and professional people employed at this establishment who are not deserving of this review. But you are only as strong as your weakest link, and I could not go in good conscious without posting something. To top it off, she actually took my phone out of my hand to take back to the kitchen after she told me she didn't know if they could make a Lego cookie. She said nothing else after saying she didn't know if they could make the cookie, lips harshly pursed while looking off to the side (yes, that is actually an accurate account)! So I asked if she could ask the bakers. ( I was already very offended at this point). She offered another rude expression, shook her head at me and grabbed MY phone without even asking me if she could take it for a minute, which I would have gladly allowed her to do. I'm absolutely blown away! She can't possibly be like this to everyone! To conclude here, upon leaving I said that I would not be purchasing the cookies, that she had been very rude and that she seemed to be a very unhappy person. She smiled the most smirky smile I will probably ever see in person until my kids are teenagers, and so I walked out. I felt nothing but sadness upon walking out of there and will not be coming back.

Decided not to \"yelp\" it until I went to the \"sister\" location next door. They are both run by the same women and they even have an open door between the two locations. It's just that the other serves lunch. \nYesterday I took a couple people to try it.  One was my friend that went with me a couple weeks ago and the other was a newbie. \nWe had every intention in going into the sandwich shop. Honestly we did. But the newbie wanted an espresso and after looking at the menu I couldn't shake my thoughts of the breakfast burrito that I got last week. So we apologized to the staff waiting to take our order and went through the opening to the other side.  My friend who went with me last week got the same thing from the week prior...burrito and iced tea - she said it's the best tea in the city. The newbie followed her lead and got the burrito and a double espresso. He loved both.  I really wanted to try something different. I wanted this review to talk about something other than a breakfast burrito but I couldn't do it.  I did however get an iced Chai tea latte with a shot of espresso. \nA little backstory before I tell you how I really feel about this burrito and my beverage. There was this place on Hampton that I went to weekly for breakfast. He had the best breakfast burrito and homemade salsa in Saint Louis.  It was the perfect heat (even for me...I'm a wuss) and he served it with potatoes and it was a delightfully filling meal. Sadly, he isn't open anymore but I'll continue to rate any breakfast burrito against his. \nAll that being said this breakfast burrito is chock full of egg with the perfect amount of bacon. I'm guessing the bacon is chopped because there aren't any tough bites where you have to rip a piece of bacon in half. You know what I'm saying? The salsa isn't made in house but I was told it's made somewhere in town. So not some Old El Paso stuff.  It again looked like it wasn't enough food but it honestly was the right amount. As for my beverage... this is why it's a 4 for me (it would probably be a 5 for my pals but hey, I'm writing this) - last week I had the black tea and while I always put sweetener in it I had to put more cuz it was a little too bitter for me.  Not bitter as in old but bitter bitter.  (That should clear it up.  Haha) Yesterday's Chai tea latte with the shot of espresso was also bitter. I know what you are thinking but when I get this at other locations it's not bitter. The good thing about it is that I didn't slurp it all down real fast like I usually do I really took my time with it.  So it lasted through my breakfast. Which was nice because even though it was really warm out there was a great breeze on the outside patio. \nI'll let you know if I ever get to the sandwich shop. Not sure if that's gonna happen any time soon since I'm already thinking about that breakfast burrito.","name":"Espresso Yourself Coffee & Cafe","address":"5351 Devonshire Ave","city":"St. Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63109","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":46,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BusinessAcceptsBitcoin":"False","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","Caters":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","Alcohol":"u'none'","HappyHour":"False","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","GoodForKids":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","Corkage":"False","WheelchairAccessible":"True","WiFi":"u'free'","BYOB":"False","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"False","DogsAllowed":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","HasTV":"True"},"categories":"Caterers, Event Planning & Services, Restaurants, Food, Cafes, Coffee & Tea"},{"review_id":"jMNWks53SUanDy6F5j-ygg","business_id":"Vo6qANHRdcJPdGryYZ5YEw","stars_x":2.0,"date":1634575792000,"text":"I ordered it from Espresso Yourself Coffee and caf\u00c3\u00a9 for the first time via Uber eats.

I'm no beer guy by any means, but it was nice to have a chance to try some brands I may never have tried before, and hosting events like this will make me at least pay attention.  \n\nMost of the rest of my time here has been a lunch stop, where the salad bar has been a weekly stop for me.  Along with the salad bar, there is a decent sized selection of hot foods, pre-made sandwiches, soups, and desserts.  Despite all the options for the food, I think my favorite feature of this particular Schnucks is the mini checkout counter for the entire lunch area.  Forget taking that salad to the main registers for checkout, just pay at the lunch checkout and be on your way.

The people at customer service have been somewhat rude when I have had a question or have had issues with the self-checkout area. \n\nSince this store is within a half-mile of my house, I tend to find myself going here more often now than driving somewhere else, however if I'm not busy and do not mind driving to another grocery store then I tend to go somewhere else for cheaper groceries.","name":"Schnucks Lindenwood","address":"1900 First Capitol Dr","city":"Saint Charles","state":"MO","postal_code":"63301","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":21,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","HasTV":"False","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","GoodForKids":"False","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","Alcohol":"'full_bar'","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","WiFi":"'free'","NoiseLevel":"'average'","Caters":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"False","OutdoorSeating":"None"},"categories":"Florists, Drugstores, Flowers & Gifts, Food, Restaurants, Grocery, Bakeries, Shopping, Delis"},{"review_id":"zYWQ6v5VioL9U6mVAAZfpg","business_id":"mVR0Q82u4QlQLBQ0NU_izg","stars_x":3.0,"date":1564881104000,"text":"Have eaten here many times for lunch they usually put a lot of meat on there sandwiches  but today was very disappointing brought my wife there for the first time so disappointed with  the quality of the sandwiches","name":"Valenti's Delicatessen and Market","address":"105 N Main St","city":"Saint Charles","state":"MO","postal_code":"63301","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":44,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}","WiFi":"u'free'","OutdoorSeating":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","WheelchairAccessible":"False","Caters":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","HasTV":"True","Alcohol":"u'none'","DogsAllowed":"False","RestaurantsTableService":"False","GoodForKids":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"False","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True"},"categories":"Sandwiches, Restaurants, Desserts, Food, Delis"},{"review_id":"gQo72va0hoKsrvnJKlvBBQ","business_id":"mVR0Q82u4QlQLBQ0NU_izg","stars_x":5.0,"date":1610110880000,"text":"Quality food and service.

It's now the closest Schnucks to my house and also the closest grocery store to my house (although IGA might be a tad closer, it's a lot smaller.)\n\nWas pretty excited for the opening of this store. While I find Dierbergs to be acceptable, their prices are also pretty outrageous sometimes (at times entering the Whole Foods\/Paycheck realm of insanity) so I am glad I can drive a shorter distance to get cheaper food at the same quality or better. \nBut there are still items they simply do not carry at this store, e.g. Soy Vay. I was crushed when I saw they didn't have it. But instead of going to Dierbergs, I just bought a three pack on amazon, hell yea! You can request that the begin carrying a certain product at the front, though I did this right when they first opened (I wanna say August 2014?) and they never called me about it, so I wonder if they just couldn't get it thru the distributor or what? Either way, not the end of the world, just a point I wanted to note.\n\nI like the sushi counter because there's this one really friendly dude who has my favorite combos memorized and he sees me coming and knows what's up. I usually grab that, and a bottle of wine, or two, or three.... their wine prices still can't beat TJ's unless there's a sale, but whatevs. Until they open a TJ's in St. Chuck, I don't mind coming here. Nice, new, and clean.\n\nUnfortunately, every time I go to check out, there's ALWAYS a person in front of me paying with a check. I was like....wtf. Bro, do you even credit card? It wouldn't be a pain or anything normally, but in the particular instances in which I had the misfortune of getting sandwiched into a lane with said check writer in front of me, the individual made an error, or the cashier made an error, which led to the whole thing becoming a 5-10 minute ordeal. At which point all of my crap was already on the conveyor and I just shrugged and stood there reading trashy magazines and forcing myself to not start eating kit kats. :P Really not a Schnucks problem as much of a weirdo St. Chuck people thing. lol. \n\nOh yeah and they have tiramisu gelato.

Even my son who is 15 and had bacon, eggs, potatoes and toast said the butter was the best he ever had lol. \nThis restaurant stands up to many brunches we've had in New Orleans and just might be the best one we've had in STL.","name":"Bowood by Niche","address":"4605 Olive St","city":"St. Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63108","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":22,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsTableService":"True","BYOB":"True","WheelchairAccessible":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"False","Caters":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","HasTV":"False","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","Corkage":"True","WiFi":"u'free'","OutdoorSeating":"False","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': None, u'street': True, u'lot': None, u'validated': None}"},"categories":"Restaurants, Food, Sandwiches, Desserts, Breakfast & Brunch"},{"review_id":"_R3n4wY4Pa5-rSTph-2GIw","business_id":"mVR0Q82u4QlQLBQ0NU_izg","stars_x":5.0,"date":1641959161000,"text":"Very good sandwiches and friendly service.

One of my great aunt's 2 story house where she always had tea and homemade bread for you even if she didn't know you were coming.  Country music playing, tin ceiling, home baked items in a display case and a friendly greeting as you walked in the door. \nWe found this place by accident. We had gone to Soulard Market to get some plants and was just checking out the buildings around it and decided to stop in for breakfast. We were too early but one of the owners was loading up his truck with treats to sell at the market and said they would be opening in about 30 minutes. So we went for a walk. We got back just as they opened at 8am. So glad we waited. \nThis place was clean and so inviting. I ordered the Country Classic which is 2 eggs (I had mine scrambled and the only bad thing I can say about them is that there weren't enough...I don't know what they put in them but I assure you those were no ordinary scrambled eggs), sausage (homemade... and not with a strange sage flavor that leaves you tasting the sausage later on in the day), fried potatoes (there were a TON of these but I personally thought they were a little overcooked), then there was the biscuit (a REAL biscuit... not one of those round flaky things,  this solid biscuit was the size of a medium loaf of bread and so tasty). My friend got the same as me but she got grits. (She KNOWS grits and was thrilled with these. I am new to the \"grit scene\" and plain grits just don't do it for me but these? I could have eaten a bushel of these. \nOne of the owners said they used to have a farm in Maryland Heights but sold it yesterday (I believe).

We passed a new business ( found out later they opened last October)  in a space previously occupied by a bar who's name I can't remember. Mauki's Bakery & Country Store. We decided to stop on the way back to the car when we were finished at the market. We passed Mauki's stall in the market and saw a wide selection of dessert breads that interested us. We headed to the store and were discussing getting breakfast or lunch somewhere as we entered. We were greeted immediately and asked if we were eating. The name doesn't include restaurant and I missed the small Sign outside advertising food. \nAfter looking at the pies, cookies, breads etc we looked at the menu and decided to dine here. Best decision I've made in a while. We sat down and the cheerful woman who greeted us introduced herself as Chrystal  and handed us menus. Breakfast and lunch choices both looked good. We started with Iced tea and an excellent iced coffee. Then ordered a half order of Biscuits N Gravy. (Warning! The half order is massive! ) and a Hearty Cluck sandwich \nThe food arrived in a reasonable amount of time, was visually appealing and tasted great. The biscuits are square cut sheet pan biscuits. The gravy has a generous amount of sausage and is well seasoned. The chicken fried steak is coated in crisp batter and super tender. Great southern cooking. \nThis place is a hidden gem. Wonderful food and hospitality.  One of the best breakfast restaurants in the St Louis area.","name":"Mauki's Bakery & Country Store","address":"1730 S 8th St","city":"St Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63104","stars_y":5.0,"review_count":32,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"HasTV":"True","WiFi":"u'free'","Alcohol":"u'none'","Corkage":"False","DogsAllowed":"True","WheelchairAccessible":"False","Caters":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"True","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': None, u'street': True, u'lot': False, u'validated': None}","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","BYOB":"True"},"categories":"Food, Bakeries, Donuts, Breakfast & Brunch, Comfort Food, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"KcYKLTcEXluY9iPHuTK7pw","business_id":"fimN43BUUakBXeRUQqkYvA","stars_x":4.0,"date":1623208399000,"text":"I have been stopping by this Starbucks location on the weekends lately as I visit Pharaoh's Donuts across the street.

Service is quick, the staff are personable (even when slammed under the morning rush) and the atmosphere is a little less corporate in feel. There's little mistaking that you're in a Starbucks when you step in the door, but it's also distinctly the Central West End Starbucks.\n\nSkim the reviews (or Google Maps) and you'll find just about all that you need to know for a great visit to this walkable store.\n\nThere's no dedicated parking lot or pickup spot, but there a few sturdier places to lock up a bike on the block. (Drivers do have options though. There's a public garage above the Schlafly Library on Euclid and metered parking along the street. Free street parking is often available to the east of the shop on Maryland Ave and there's a paid parking lot across the street too).\n\nThere's no drive-thru, but mobile orders are usually accepted. The location isn't that large, but does have a good mix of semi-communal seating, small tables, sidewalk seating and a couple of more comfortable chairs.\n\nIf there's really any complaint with the store, it's the minor irritation of its tendency to sell out of products, whether it's Blonde Roast, breakfast sandwiches or Nitro Cold Brew (each of which have been unavailable at least once during my random stops in over the past year). I've never had that affect an app order but, if you have your mind set on a particular item, it's probably best to order ahead.","name":"Starbucks","address":"4656 Maryland Ave","city":"St. Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63108","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":43,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"OutdoorSeating":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","WiFi":"u'free'","ByAppointmentOnly":"False","Caters":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True"},"categories":"Food, Restaurants, Coffee & Tea"},{"review_id":"F0fI4dzQtKxhpa1Zl3ylGA","business_id":"8iUZth_qBgz_GTgaIgyOaw","stars_x":5.0,"date":1632429914000,"text":"I love this home town cooking breakfast spot!\n\nEveryone that works here is so nice and they love their homemade hot sauce. \n\nAll of us went for the sweet side of breakfast and we weren't disappointed.

Being right down from where I was located I thought it was a better alternative to a sonic or jack n the box (both not good). \n\nAs I pulled up to the first window a rather friendly lady greeted me. Because there are no pictures or any frame of reference for how big or small the burgers are I ordered a double bacon cheeseburger. When I tried to order a milkshake she chuckled and showed me the list of vess soda's available. The driveway is a little tricky because when you go to pull around its like the turning radius is not enough, but I made it...\n\nSo My burger and fries shortly came out ($8.90) in a brown paper bag with the grease stains...yum... I made my way down to the seven eleven got a big gulp and was on my way back. \n\nWhile in the car who can resist a few fries so I had a couple...they were so hot and those big kinda steak fries so super good. Could have used a pinch more of salt I thought at the time. \n\nOk so when I got to where I was going I opened my brown paper bag...WOW the burger was half the size of my big gulp!!! I mean it was huge...I wish I had taken a picture... But it was made in a Big Mac style bun in between and the patties were just so darn thick. I had to cut it in half and could barely finish my half. I got everything on it so it was extra juicy.\n\nThis place is about as good as it gets for burgers in North County. Yes its a little awkward and I'm not sure about the prices but if you are looking for a huge burger that is super fresh then you should def try them out.","name":"The White Barn","address":"2457 Chambers Rd","city":"Saint Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63136","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":28,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"HasTV":"False","BikeParking":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","GoodForKids":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","RestaurantsReservations":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","OutdoorSeating":"False","Alcohol":"u'none'","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","Caters":"False","WheelchairAccessible":"True","WiFi":"u'no'","RestaurantsTableService":"False","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}","HappyHour":"False","ByAppointmentOnly":"False","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}"},"categories":"Burgers, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"ujZSTiIJpbZmPlg5_W2d8w","business_id":"dLtvYS2OPDtzDp_YEgEB3w","stars_x":5.0,"date":1511395150000,"text":"Delicious food.

The wait staff were extremely nice and friendly and attentive. My friend got scallops and their apple cobbler; I got a margherita pizza and their candy bar dessert. \nThe food took a longer time than anticipated to come out and they weren't super-busy. When the scallops came out I was a tad bit disappointed at their presentation because they were...well, burnt. Scallops have a natural buttery taste, even if you don't really use butter while cooking them. These had maybe the slightest hint of butter and the tops were just torched. It's really difficult to not make scallops tasty. My pizza was really good but also pretty dang spicy. A little goes a long way when using red pepper flakes. My nose started to run while eating this, haha. If that's what they're going for, then fantastic but I don't know if they were. \n\nThe desserts, however, were on-point. Both were very flavorful and worth savoring every bite. The presentation of the candy bar was a little weird. There was the dessert and then a swoop of chocolate that did not look, from appearances, look appetizing or attractive. Fortunately the taste overshadowed the plating.\n\nPerhaps the kitchen was just off that night when it came to getting things out in a timely manner. But I've heard the same comments from other folks I know who ate there and they said the same thing.

It's loaded with fresh tomatoes, red onion, lettuce, and pickles and to top it off there was homemade pickled relish! The burrata was served with a light balsamic reduction and cooked pears. Our server brought us out the steak sandwich, after realizing the order was mixed up. It was fantastic! It came medium rare with delicious melted cheese.

We ordered a sausage board....the giardinera is FANtastic and the sausages are the gd bomb. I'm not exaggerating in the least.\nMesha was eager to answer all our questions, quick on service, and was absolutely delightful.\nRome came out of the kitchen to talk food with us and explain his methods. He can just keep doing what he's doing in the kitchen because it's unbelievable what amazing flavor he can get out of something as simple as a chicken. Fabulous. \n\nWe're already planning on coming back! We'll probably be regulars!!\n\nAlmost forgot (and shouldn't have): The cocktails are great. Try the Last Last Ameretto Sour.

Christmas Day 2019 and we made an open table reservation here for 10:30am as we had a plane to catch in the early afternoon.  There were 5 of us, and in fact we called to make sure they were open for brunch.  No mention of a breakfast buffet only!  Ok, we get to the Last Kitchen right at our reservation time and greeted by the hostess.  She says to give her a minute and they are only serving their breakfast buffet now.  We were kind of disappointed, but it was one of those we can get over it fast kind of issue.\nThe hostess tells us to not even sit down but to go ahead through the buffet and by then our table would be ready.  4 of us decided to wait for the table to be ready so that we could put our coats down etc.  The one who went through had no food on her plate except a couple of potatoes and some fruit.  She whispered to us there was no food left in the chafer dishes.  \nSo we all go up to get food and lo and behold-nothing!  Not even potatoes anymore.  I look around and there are 2 chef coated guys standing there staring at us and when we said there was no food, they just looked at us funny.  \nI took my empty plate back to the table and went over to the front desk of the hotel.  I asked for the manager and told him the issue.  He said he would get these chafers refilled as soon as possible.  The food kind of trickled out from there and we asked if we can get some eggs made to order since they were out of the only egg dish (fritatta).  after a while they agreed to make some eggs for 2 of us.\nWe also noticed there was NO bread or bakery items at all?  No danishes, toast, croissants, etc, nothing nada.  \nFolks- this is breakfast buffet 101- especially for a hotel kitchen to be so bad at getting food out and then not even having the MINIMUM to have a mediocre one at best and all for the low, low price of $20.00 per person.\nToast was finally brought out when our meal was done.

I also love that the head chef is a woman! We did a staycation night and while the food was wonderful, other parts of our experience could use some work. I'll break it down by meal... \n\nSnack and Drinks: \nWe were hoping to enjoy the rooftop bar once we got settled into our room, but unfortunately they weren't  serving food and I was in desperate need of a snack. Not sure if they only serve food up there in the summer? Online they said nothing about seasonal food. Definitely a bummer, but we headed down to the main bar and ordered the crab dip, which was amazing. I also had a delightful gin cocktail. \n\nDinner: \nWe made a 7:30 dinner reservation and were seated promptly. It seemed that they were understaffed, as I only ever saw two servers, the host and a food runner. Our server was very nice once she came to the table, but for a restaurant with this price point you'd expect a higher level of service. We ordered cocktails and the fried brussel sprouts as a starter, which came out pretty quickly. I am obsessed with brussel sprouts, but unfortunately these were heavy with a tempura style batter. They were good, but just too much. For entrees I had the steak and my boyfriend had the gumbo and a side of fries. The steak and fingerling potatoes were delicious, and he really liked the gumbo. The fries were very boring, which was surprising for this style of restaurant. I also wish there was some divider between the restaurant and the bar\/lobby because it was so loud. Didn't help that there was a wine tasting event in the hotel that night and drunk people were literally everywhere. I also feel like they could do something to soften the dinning area a bit... maybe plants or artwork between the windows? The space just needs a little something. Overall we had a very nice dinner, there were  just small things that could have made the experience better. \n\nBreakfast:\nWe were seated right away around 10am on a Sunday. The menu isn't large but has a nice variety. I ordered pancakes and he got biscuits and gravy, which were both delicious. The pancakes are super rich, and the nuts and chocolate chips were a nice addition. They have these super cute coffee cups that I'm pretty sure I read were made for them by a local potter, but they don't have handles and my cup was so hot I could barely touch it. (Later I saw someone near us with what looked like a leather sleeve on his cup but by this point my coffee had cooled enough I didn't bother asking for one). Service was a bit slow, and the three people working seemed a bit scattered considering the restaurant wasn't full. We were never offered coffee refills and we sat for quite while waiting on the check.

That played to our advantage at this restaurant because literally everything was good.  From the chicken bites and toasted ravs that we had for appetizers, to the shrimp po boy, duck pot pie, pizza, and adult buttered noodles that we had for entrees, and then finishing off with the coconut caramel cake, ALL of it tasted so good!  The only reason for the 4 star review was the temperature of the appetizers - they were on the room temperature side and the chicken could've been crispier.

Absolutely fantastic!  Our Pizza had a delightful fresh crispy thin crust and was lightly sauced (the way my wife likes it).  The italian sausage was a flavorful link sausage which had been it into slices.  The cheese tasted like some sort of blend, predominantly provel; we loved it.  This is St Louis Style Pizza at its best.  \n\nOur lasagna, on the other hand, was forgettable. It was a bit loose and there wasn't much ricotta or other yumminess. It was mostly meat sauce and noodles, with a slice of provel on top. \n\nI also had the dinner salad with the garlic vinaigrette. The salad was topped with a generous portion of provel and the dressing was great. I recommend it. \n\nThe atmosphere here is strictly low rent - padded metal chairs, Formica tables, and the original tile floor from the 60's, with a half dozen tiny 19 inch TVs on the wall. The staff was very friendly and we got the impression (by eavesdropping) that this place attracts a lot of regulars.

While the restaurant itself could use a few upgrades, I actually have become fond of the homey and familiar feel I get when I arrive to one of my favorite pizza joints. \n\nSome people who previously reviewed Robertos must not be familiar with St. Louis style pizza. I remember my first time eating St. Louis style pizza (over 20 years ago) I thought that they got something wrong and their style of pizza was horrific. NOW, I wouldn't have my pizza any other way!! There is no deep dish and no hand tossed. You get your good ole thin crust pizza. My favorite pizza is the shrimp pizza. Don't be fooled, I was very reserved my first time, I wasn't sure that mini shrimp on a pizza would be good. Holy smokes, I crave this pizza all the time and we drive over 30 mins out of our way to enjoy it. I highly recommend it (don't forget to ask for extra shrimp). They also have your classic pizzas, we enjoy the Garbage pizza too (their name for supreme pizza). \nWe always start with toasted ravioli and garlic cheese bread. Two things you can't go wrong with either! \n\nThe atmosphere is very casual, they have TVs around with your favorite games on and you should grab a bucket of beer while you watch. Their buckets are a great price, unlike most places I go to these days that charge an insane amount for your basic bucket! \n\nStaff is always kind, friendly and smiling. Yes they are always busy, but it takes some patience for a great pizza and we never wait to be seated, even though every time we go, it's a full house! Janice is the owner and usually serves us as well. Talk about an amazing woman! She is so kind and makes each time we visit, a great experience. \n\nI would say, don't knock it until you try it. We don't live anywhere near it and make sure to eat there at least once a month. It would be great to chow on some pizza while you watch the Blues or Cards play! It's the epitome of traditional St. Louis, now go grab some pizza and cold brews!","name":"Roberto's Italian Restaurant","address":"16 Mullanphy Garden Shopping Ctr","city":"Florissant","state":"MO","postal_code":"63031","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":34,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","OutdoorSeating":"False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","HasTV":"True","GoodForKids":"True","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","BikeParking":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"},"categories":"Restaurants, Italian, Pizza"},{"review_id":"8TAYZZEnJF6icEGYEdckXA","business_id":"BF0D-qOG3vBxVAKgg0JFqg","stars_x":4.0,"date":1463874729000,"text":"We decided to grab a quick lunch after running errands and Krueger's was on the way home.

First thing I noticed was that the food costs about double what stereotypical fast food costs, even though this is essentially the same stuff - but I suppose it should be much better.  And I was already there to try it out, so...placed the order and was told it would take 5 to 10 minutes.  And it took about 10 minutes, for 3 chicken sandwiches, 2 orders of fries, and 1 order of chicken fingers.  Seemed like  long time, but then it needed to be since the chicken was cooked up fresh.  I'd rather have it fresh an hot, so not a problem for me.\n\nThe chicken on both the sandwich and the fingers was juicy and flavorful, with a well-spiced (but not chili spice),  crispy coating.  They hit the mark there.  Don't know that it was twice as good as fast food, but it was good.  The sandwiches came with 4 bread & butter pickles.  They had a good snap, but not a lot of tartness in that variety.  I think a little bit of tart would have set off well from the chicken.  And the sandwiches came with mayo on them.  Personally, I'd have preferred to put one of their own sauces on the sandwich.\n\nFries were thinner than a typical crinkle cut, with a good peppery spice on them.  I though the fries were top notch.  And a generous portion too.\n\nYou have to get your own sauces from the dispensers, if you want more than just ketchup for your to go orders.  But the person giving me the bag informed me of that, so no problem.  And that way I could take extra, to make sure I didn't run out - and some for later.  We took some Andouille (I think) sauce, which was basically a spicy mayo with a sneaky heat - it was really good for dipping the fries; and took some of their \"secret sauce\", which was a sweetish, syrup thick sauce - hard for me to define it, but it made a good chicken dip.\n\nSo a decent experience overall.  Pretty good food, takes a bit of time but you want it fresh and hot, still not sure if it's 2x as good as fast food for 2x the price.","name":"Chicken Out","address":"10463 Manchester Rd","city":"Kirkwood","state":"MO","postal_code":"63122","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":31,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsDelivery":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True"},"categories":"Sandwiches, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"wTP99OgsuTL8cg_zKpfVwQ","business_id":"BF0D-qOG3vBxVAKgg0JFqg","stars_x":2.0,"date":1569789876000,"text":"I heard that this bar was really nice.

She found seats for us at the bar and after a few minutes Nick came over to advise us of our drink choices.  With the volume of the music it would've been nice to see a written description of the drinks. But luckily I made a good selection with the drink the gin drink that had cucumber.  I'm not really a gin person but when I heard cucumber I was sold. My friend had the cognac drink. She liked it OK but it was a bit too sweet and seem to be a better after dinner sipping type of drink. We ordered two of those small plates. I got the calamari and my friend got the pork sliders. \nThe pork sliders were too spicy for my taste however the menu does mention that they have a little kick. The calamari was good but I felt like the serving was pretty small especially when you compared it to the pork sliders. For our next round of drinks my friend had another bartender make her up a old fashion that he created. She definitely enjoyed that. Bartender number two, whose name I didn't get, made my 2nd gin cocktail and surprisingly it wasn't as good as the 1st one. I did notice in my first cocktail there was a slice of fresh cucumber and in the second one it was the dried cucumber not sure that that makes the difference but something did! I know that one of the things about this event was that we were supposed to help come up with names for their new cocktails but there wasn't really a good way to convey any of the ideas that we had. \nThe atmosphere at \nTakashima Record Bar is sort of a combo of modern meets mysterious.

The owners paid attention to detail with even the silverware being shiny black. I loved it. \nOne thing I don't really get (maybe it's my age) is how a record bar is different than playing music over the speaker system.  It is not like you could go talk to the DJ or make requests. And the whole time I was there the music was the in the same genre. It was good even though I would not have played it at home. \nOverall this is fun place to grab a drink after dinner or work. The staff was attentive and kind. They do have a variety of offerings to meet most anyone's needs. I would suggest that the owners get a bigger sign though so people can find it easier. \nJason - thanks for the sweet Spotify play list and plastic case!

As someone who didn't grow up in a big city, I am not as comfortable driving in the city of St. Louis.  There isn't that much street parking, but there is a free lot a couple of minutes from the bar.  I was greeted at the door by the hostess and felt a lot more comfortable after talking about the safety of the neighborhood as I had made sure before leaving my home that I had made sure that there wasn't anything in plain sight inside my car.  \n\nTakashima Record Bar is a clean and cozy Japanese style bar with attentive bar staff.  I was seated at the bar and enjoyed music play as a DJ changed songs from different artists.  It was such a different atmosphere than what I am used to, and even though I didn't recognize any of the songs that played I enjoyed all of them.  As you look across the bar your eyes are almost mesmerized by the number of record albums that are displayed on the walls like art.  I am not always great with names but the bartender was so attentive and friendly.  The first cocktail I tried was made with Cognac, it was a classic Japanese style drink.  I haven't ever tried Cognac before and wanted to try something new.  It had hints of orange but it was really strong and I will be honest, I couldn't finish it.  I also ordered the Pulled Pork Sliders.  If you are someone who really likes spicy food, then this is a dish for you.  I have a low tolerance when it comes to spicy food and so this was a bad choice for me.  The creamy slaw, pickled onions, and onion straws that came with it were really good though.  I definitely want to come back and try their goat and beet salad.  That looked really good.  The last drink I had was a Shochu Cocktail.  The bartender was able to leave out the spice that they normally put in after the pulled pork debacle.  This cocktail was more to my liking because it was made with rum and coconut milk.  I finished this drink and this was definitely better than the first one that I had.  \n\nOverall I would rate Takashima Record Bar with 5 stars because the staff were excellent.  For the venue being a bar and a place with a DJ, the noise level wasn't that bad.  I didn't come to the venue with anyone but talking to the bartender wasn't difficult.  The bar and bathrooms were clean.  Even though I didn't like the pulled pork because it was too spicy that is personal preference.  I would recommend this place to other people, especially those of my friends who love music.  I am glad they open a little earlier (at 4pm) as someone who can't drink late at night because of migraines it is nice to be able to go someone without having to worry too much about that.  The one thing I would say is that the price of the cocktails was more than I would pay, but once in a while it is okay.  Overall it was a great experience!","name":"Takashima Record Bar","address":"4095 Chouteau Ave","city":"St. Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63110","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":35,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsReservations":"True","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': None, u'casual': None, u'touristy': None, u'trendy': True, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': None, u'classy': True, u'upscale': None}","CoatCheck":"False","WheelchairAccessible":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","BestNights":"{u'monday': False, u'tuesday': False, u'wednesday': False, u'thursday': False, u'friday': False, u'saturday': False, u'sunday': False}","Music":"{u'dj': False, u'live': False, u'jukebox': False, u'video': False, u'background_music': False, u'karaoke': False, u'no_music': False}","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': None, u'street': True, u'lot': False, u'validated': False}","NoiseLevel":"u'loud'","RestaurantsTableService":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'"},"categories":"Nightlife, Restaurants, Cocktail Bars, Tapas Bars, Bars, Lounges"},{"review_id":"vBPKbtAJdz8jj9BDXgl7qA","business_id":"FljrXsruuoFB6v8InG-3Ig","stars_x":5.0,"date":1640929189000,"text":"Awesome place, second time being here and it did not disappoint.

It's not cheap alcohol or food, but for the most part, the menu is full of combinations that you're not likely to see elsewhere. It seemed like the mixed drinks averaged about $13 each. And they are not stingy on the liquor.

My friend and I were repeatedly bumped into while sitting at the bar. One drunk golfer nearly fell down as he spun around and fell into our chairs uttering \"sorry\" in a blacked-out, blank face. If our chairs were not there he would still be falling. This did not stop the bartender from serving them shots of Fireball! Mind you this was 7-9pm. They obviously were drinking on the golf course all day. CUT THEM OFF FOR EVERYONE'S SAKE ALREADY!! It was very unpleasant just sitting there as we kept getting encroached on by drunks! The last straw was when one of them started twisting my beer bottle in my bucket - right in front of me at my seat! I asked what he was doing and he said he thought it was his bucket. For God's sake it had been sitting in front of me for an hour and was a 40 ounce bottle. When I raised my voice and asked him to get away people took notice. A bouncer suggested we all separate. I had nowhere to go - I was simply sitting at the bar in my stool next to my friend. Some backed off for a while and then came an MS-13 looking tattooed Mexican. He stood with his back to me about 4 inches from my elbow and allowed me to inhale all of the smoke from his cigarette - that he was not smoking. The golfers started buying him drinks for continuing the aggressive inconsideration towards us. Bartenders began ignoring us and essentially stopped service. DO NOT GO HERE!! It is a closed group, drunks were continued to be served and the management did not protect our right to sit at the bar and mind our own business.

They also have decent drink specials which I have taken advantage of. There is not a huge selection of beer on-tap,  just FYI.\n\nThe bar itself is located on a street corner in the middle of the neighborhood. That neighborhood-aspect makes the bar feel very cozy. I can't wait to go here in the winter! They also have a nice patio out front you can sit on with stringed lights. The reason I knocked one star off is because I wish they dimmed the lights a bit more on the inside. Obviously this is not much of an issue though at all.

A Missouri dog nods to St Louis with toppings of toasted ravioli, marinara sauce and--perplexingly--queso. The New York City Pizza Dog also has queso plus marinara sauce. \nSome menu items are downright odd. A vegetarian hot dog? Yep.

All the draft selections were from local craft breweries: Urban Chestnut, Civil Life, Four Hands, O'Fallon, Schlafly, and Griesedieck's.  In bottles were macro swill and a fascinating list of Belgian beers, including a Flander's Red sour.  The selection isn't a long list yet, but I'm very impressed so far.\n\nWe both had cheese burgers with a basket of fries to share.  My wife also had the caesar salad.  All the food was tasty and right on bar for a neighborhood bar.  The burgers were simple and juicy without pretension.\n\nWe're very excited to have a new food option down the block. I'm sure we'll be regulars at Thurman's.","name":"Thurman's in Shaw","address":"4069 Shenandoah Ave","city":"Saint Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63110","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":38,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"HasTV":"True","BikeParking":"True","DogsAllowed":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","WheelchairAccessible":"True","GoodForDancing":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","Smoking":"u'outdoor'","RestaurantsReservations":"False","WiFi":"u'free'","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","CoatCheck":"False","OutdoorSeating":"True","BestNights":"{'monday': False, 'tuesday': False, 'friday': False, 'wednesday': False, 'thursday': False, 'sunday': False, 'saturday': False}","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","HappyHour":"True","Ambience":"{'touristy': None, 'hipster': None, 'romantic': None, 'divey': None, 'intimate': None, 'trendy': None, 'upscale': False, 'classy': None, 'casual': None}","Music":"{'dj': False, 'background_music': False, 'no_music': False, 'jukebox': False, 'live': True, 'video': False, 'karaoke': False}"},"categories":"Sandwiches, Pizza, Pubs, Bars, Nightlife, Jazz & Blues, Beer Bar, Mexican, Restaurants, Arts & Entertainment"},{"review_id":"lVqLSJnMLMyUPNDpXpGscg","business_id":"a-oshK5drqQfSgLYvmwOKA","stars_x":5.0,"date":1565302929000,"text":"I come in every Friday and some Saturdays.

From one industry professional to another, don't the haters get you down. Karma's a bitch \n\nBack to our experience: we were greeted by two, a trainee with a shadow. I believe they introduced themselves as \"M.L.\" Or maybe... Em Elle? Anyway, they were wonderful. And the shadow trainer was present but did not enter the conversation unless needed, creating a good boost of confidence for the trainee. Both had great recommendations on cocktails, apps, pizza, entrees and wine. We felt very welcome. \n\nTo start off we both got a Black Manhattan, it was so smooth. The booze sort of snuck up on us. (Not to insinuate it wasn't boozy, we felt it ). On the servers' recommendation we moved on to the Calimari. OMFG - wow. Never had a Calimari without a dipping sauce before, but it did not need it, giardiniera  was fried in with it and it was bursting with complimentary flavors. \n\nFor entrees, bday lady got the eggplant parm and we split a pizza. She said the texture was a little weird for her, but the flavor was awesome. Neither of us are red-meat eaters, so we got the sausage-ricotta-giardiniera pizza, minus the sausage. We also splurged on a side of the house made hot honey. It was upscale flavor town, like guy fieri in a tux. seriously tho, it was yum. \n\nThe ambiance was totally our cup of tea.

We went during the week to avoid what we thought would be crowds. We ordered the handmade toasted ravioli which we extremely tasty and I would stack up against any handmade ravioli on the Hill. Next we split the Caesar salad with hot croutons and I would stay that this was great as well. Lastly we decided on a pizza since this is (should be) their specialty since it's in their name, we were extremely DISPOINTED in this. We found this supposedly New Haven style pizza to be terrible, the pizza crust was soggy especially in the middle. I am not sure if they have not fine-tuned their recipe or need a better pizza oven or are afraid of a little charred crust, but they need to work on cooking the pie all the way through and need to perfect this if they want to keep \"Pizza\" in the name.\n\nThe drinks as at Olive & Oak were excellent. I did feel that the wine by the glass was overpriced for the tiny pour they give you.\nIf I go back, I would stay away from the pizza and stick with some of the pasta dishes instead.\n\nMy review is solely based on the above and did not factor in anything I mention below, which would have lowered it even further.\n\nOkay we have dined at several restaurants in past three months since we are trying to support as many businesses as possible, but this place was a first with regard to COVID precautions. They require customers to put their mask on each time a waitress or any employee approaches you table. I understand the need to be careful, but this is overkill and very annoying for the table, stopping in mid bite to put your mask on or just constantly trying to pay attention to what the employees are doing in case they come near your table is not a relaxing night out. As customers, we all understand the risk associated with dining out and if we are in your restaurant we are comfortable with that risk. If you as a restaurant or your employees are fearful then; 1) DO Not OPEN, 2) Do not come to work if you are an employee, or 3) Protect you staff further with either face shields or even have them put on fully biohazard suits (this is overkill, but so is putting mask on and off 20 times during a night out).","name":"O+O Pizza","address":"102 W Lockwood Ave","city":"St. Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63119","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":38,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Ambience":"{u'divey': False, u'hipster': False, u'casual': False, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': False, u'intimate': False, u'romantic': False, u'classy': True, u'upscale': False}","OutdoorSeating":"True","GoodForKids":"True"},"categories":"Bars, Pizza, Nightlife, Restaurants, Italian"},{"review_id":"b_TktU9qa0V3a3bm3EN7Pw","business_id":"97w1oemqGL_I-gchNIHZGw","stars_x":5.0,"date":1625692573000,"text":"We stopped in for drinks only at O+O Pizza last night to celebrate our daughter's 21st birthday, and had ML and Kyle take outstanding care of us!

To start, each order of fries were more on the soggy, Luke warm end. None were crispy or hot. They are also marketed as seasoned fries, but sadly the seasoning was not mixed together very well and just a ton of seasoning was on a few pieces in each batch. I got the crispy fish sandwich and it was very undercooked. I took a bite or two and noticed and decided it would be best not to finish. My boyfriend got a hot dog and said it was just okay. The catfish nuggets we got we were not a fan of either. The menu also specified we get fries and coleslaw with the catfish nugget meal but we just realized we didn't get any nor did they mention they were out. It began to get incredibly crowded so I didn't want to cause a scene and mention to the employees about my undercooked food or ask for a refund.

They're extremely strict with their COVID policy, you have to wear a mask every time the server approaches your table ( upto 10 times, to take orders for drinks\/ apps, check on us, serve dishes, settle the bill etc). I respect that. I did not mind wearing and removing my mask in the middle of my meal that often, too much, but if it can kill your buzz, this is not the place for you. After a couple of drinks, it can get a little irritating for some folks.\n\nThe drinks: The torino sour: Decent, I'd give it a 7\/10. Can't go wrong with gin and lemon.\nSpiced pear sangria: oh my goodness! This warm cup filled me up. The only hot alcoholic drink I've had before, has been a hot toddy or cider. This was a pleasant surprise. It's hot and sour with a hint of pear. \nThere was a mocktail with turmeric and ginger,the name is slipping from my mind, but it was the most unique flavorful drink I've ever had!\n\nFried gnocchi: The mix of the crunch and soft center is pleasing, it's a light appetizer which pairs well with our drinks.\n\nRigatoni: Yummy! This warm creamy pasta was split for the two of us, and the portion was more than enough. The sauce is seasoned well, the Rigatoni melts in your mouth, and the small pieces of lobster make the whole dish smell and taste absolutely divine!\n\nMargherita pizza: This was so underwhelming :(.

The only reason why I'm deducting a star for the review. \n\nMy friends had the halibut with Cesar salad, which they really enjoyed as well. \n\nWe topped everything off with the famous Clover and Bee Tiramisu.

Holy smokes, the gnocchi was the best thing we ate.  Served with pork belly in a rosemary cider cream sauce, I could have most likely eaten this as my entree.  Gnocchi was pillowy and whole dish was stellar and complex.  The polenta and ragu that was served with the meatballs was also tasty but I felt that the meatball texture was off, a big spongy, too tightly packed.\n\nThe Caesar salad was tasty though the croutons were more like large pieces of crispy bread.  Tasted great but were challenging to eat as a part of the salad.\n\nWhile it's O&O Pizza, we didn't actually get pizza...  For entrees we tried the lobster rigatoni and the agnolotti.  The rigatoni was a surprise favorite.  My husband was suspect of lobster in his pasta, but upon tasting it, we both agreed it was a fantastic dish.  The calabrian chilies added a bit of spice that cut the richness from the cream sauce. There was also a surprisingly hefty portion of lobster, yay!  The agnolotti was a miss.  The pasta was great but the garlic butter sauce and the sun-dried tomatoes added zero flavor.  I would like to see this pasta preparation revamped.  Slap some of that rosemary cider cream on them! \n\nAll in all, good price for the quality of the food, easy ordering app and curbside pick-up.

My order Country Fried steak with gravy, two eggs over easy with potatoes and toast. I really enjoyed. \n\nApproximately 20 minutes later food was on the table and timing was correct for everyone at the same time. My dish was very good. The coffee was excellent! Everyone else also really enjoyed. Service my our single female waitress was outstanding with follow up on food, refills on water and coffee. Price for the amount and quality about right. \n\nI think a 4.5 best suits them. There was no service errors. Our timing of being seated and food arrival was above average.

It is an upscale diner, that serves delicious comfort food for both breakfast and lunch on the edge of downtown Clayton. It has a full service bar and they make one killer Spicy Bloody Mary that is always a go to for me. \n\nOn my first visit I intended to order their, Slinger after seeing chef Eric preparing on TV. Come on, The Slinger is a St Louis classic breakfast, why wouldn't I give it a try? Then as I sat at the bar, I saw the pictures posted of their Damn Delicious and thought I'd give it a try. The server also shared with me that the DD was chef Eric's favorite. \n\nAs I got ready to order, my attention went in another direction. I saw another picture posted here on Yelp of the Veggie Hash. I love Brussels Sprouts, so I was sold. I enjoyed a full plate of fresh, crisp sprouts covered with two eggs over easy. Delicious! I couldn't be totally healthy, I had to add a side of bacon and Hash Browns. \n\nMy next visit I choose, Damn Delicious. The DD is very filling, it is a lot of food. They take two scrambled eggs with bacon and put it between a sliced croissant. They then smother that with sausage gravy, shredded cheddar and chives. If that isn't enough, it is served with a side of Hash Browns. I was so stuffed, I skipped lunch that day. \n\nI'll share a little secret with you, I prefer the Clayton location over the CWE. The service here is more personal and friendly. Veronica is a delight, excellent server. I also think the food is prepared and presented better.\n\nNote - the address is on Bonhomme Ave, but you actually enter the restaurant on Brentwood. \n\nI'll be back? - Yes!

The lady behind the counter hadn't even started in our order (place was empty) so is not like she was busy.  She was annoyed that we were there so quickly.  Not only did she move at the pace of a snail, but she also had a full on personal conversation on the phone, cursing left and right wanting to know \"who the fuck is talking all that shit\".

The stated price for delivery was very reasonable ($14 plus tip). However, they didn't deliver any of the frozen items so they had to send out another driver (which means another tip and waiting at my house for eight hours). Also, the substitutions were not reasonable IMO. E.g., they substituted an inferior brand (for the same price) for one product, substituted creamy peanut butter for crunchy peanut butter, etc. Some of the items I ordered were unavailable. No one called to see whether I still wanted delivery despite the warehouse not having several of the items I'd ordered. So what I thought was going to be a modest delivery charge for a fairly large ordered ended up being a fairly large delivery charge for a much smaller order, especially when you consider the amount of groceries I'll need to take back from this order. \n\nPart of this was my mistake in allowing substitutions but that is partly because the default on the order form is to allow substitutions. So whenever I went back to the product page to get information, it was reset to allow substitutions. I said no substitutions for most of the items but I did allow it for some. Further, they don't let you specify whether a specific type of substitution (e.g., brand, flavor) is ok, it's a global yes or no. Based on my experience, I'd strongly advise to not allow substitutions. (However, then you'll need to assume that a fairly high percentage of your order won't be delivered at all. Your choice: bad substitutions or no product.)\n\nI thought that this would be like my local Schucks store, which IME almost always has the items I\"m looking for. If they are out of an item, they often allow a good - excellent substitution or give a raincheck. Unfortunately, a far higher percentage of items that I ordered from Schnucks Express were unavailable. (That's not counting the several ad items that weren't even available for ordering on their website.)  I'd guess that almost 25% of my order was not available (and so either nothing or a bad substitute was delivered). If my local grocery store's stock were as depleted as Schnucks Express, I'd change grocery stores ASAP. Plus, you don't get a raincheck when Schnucks Express is out of a sale item. \n\nThey need to have the website update in real time so that you know what products you'll be getting. Also, it would be very helpful to have a button that let you select no substituions for the whole order. They need much better communication with the customer as well. \n\nBottom Line: If you don't mind waiting at home for 8 hours for about 3\/4 of the groceries you ordered, this is probably a good service for you. It's cheap (if you don't have to pay for more than one driver due to Schnucks Express Connection's mistakes) and (if they don't mess up your order) reasonably quick.  If you order by 7 PM, they will deliver (to your house or your local Schnucks, depending on where you live) the next day.\n\nI'm going to try this service one more time. If my experience is significantly different, I'll update the review.","name":"Schnucks - Arsenal","address":"5055 Arsenal St","city":"Saint Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63139","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Alcohol":"'full_bar'","BusinessParking":"{'valet': False, 'garage': False, 'street': False, 'lot': True, 'validated': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","Caters":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}","GoodForKids":"False","BikeParking":"True","HasTV":"False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"False","ByAppointmentOnly":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","DogsAllowed":"False","NoiseLevel":"'average'","RestaurantsTableService":"False","OutdoorSeating":"None"},"categories":"Food Delivery Services, Shopping, Delis, Restaurants, Health & Medical, Drugstores, Bakeries, Florists, Grocery, Flowers & Gifts, Food, Pharmacy"},{"review_id":"3m19XR4oQ7VaMoDueqiEvA","business_id":"MEhkXOeLwdbSZgCIpDVftg","stars_x":4.0,"date":1283093421000,"text":"This is my local Schnucks.

My boyfriend and I visited the Brentwood location on Sunday, 2\/15. The staff was very friendly, helpful, and unpretentious (which is important to me for a health-oriented business because that's not always the case). We bought 7 things to try, planning to take them for lunch a few days this week. Well, it's Wednesday and we have already eaten them because we've been making them for lunches and dinners. All of the options we've tried have been delicious - and so healthy. \n\nOne other thing I'll mention is that I'm not the hugest meat fan in general, and the thought of days old reheated meat kind of grosses me out. However, all of the meats have been very well-seasoned and moist, even reheated. I thought the meat may be a problem for me, but it's not at all.\n\nWhile the ~$10 per lunch price point is more than I might spend prepping my own meals, we all know I'll never actually prep my own meals and it's much cheaper and healthier than eating out for lunch every day. Also, they have a free rewards program where you get $5 off every $100 (or some variation of that)... basically 5% off.

I love this Schnucks as it is very close to my home.  Usually the experience is wonderful. In and out quickly with great service. \n\nToday was a different story.  Apparently the management has given up on trying to train its cashiers and baggers to be friendly and attentive.  As I was waiting in line the cashier Patti was deep into her own conversation with the bag boy about some police case she was aware of.  She went into detail about autopsies and case points while haphazardly checking out her customers. (Apparently Sherlock Holmes is her great grandfather or something.)\n\nIt was finally my turn. As I stepped forward I got not one glance and a diffident \"Hi\" that let me know I was definitley interrupting her very important conversation with the bag boy. Not once did she look up or at my groceries as she carried on with her conversation. (lucky I didnt have eggs or this would have been a disaster.) She did not tell me the price of my purchase after she was through.  I went ahead and used my debit card and entered my pin. Then I waited.  And waited. And waited some more for her to realize my part of the transaction was through.  with an annoyed face she completed her side of the transaction.  All the while still in deep convo with the bagboy. She handed me my reciept with not a word or glance.\n\nI had had enough.  I stood there waiting for her to realize that her line was not moving. As she angrily looked at me I gave her the standard Schucks \"Thank you, Have a nice day.\"  She repeated the phrase to me in what can only be described as deep and hatefilled sarcasm.  \n\nI don't think the cashiers realize the danger that lurks just a few aisles over in the form of do it yourself check out lanes.  I usually don't like going to those because I enjoy the personal touch of a good and competent human cashier.  However if service like this continues I would suggest to the manager of this store that he or she get rid of the under trained and incompetent cashiers and just fill the check out area with do it yourself aisles.","name":"Schnucks - Arsenal","address":"5055 Arsenal St","city":"Saint Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63139","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Alcohol":"'full_bar'","BusinessParking":"{'valet': False, 'garage': False, 'street': False, 'lot': True, 'validated': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","Caters":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}","GoodForKids":"False","BikeParking":"True","HasTV":"False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"False","ByAppointmentOnly":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","DogsAllowed":"False","NoiseLevel":"'average'","RestaurantsTableService":"False","OutdoorSeating":"None"},"categories":"Food Delivery Services, Shopping, Delis, Restaurants, Health & Medical, Drugstores, Bakeries, Florists, Grocery, Flowers & Gifts, Food, Pharmacy"},{"review_id":"v578_-6WDrtM_zGGfjClhQ","business_id":"MEhkXOeLwdbSZgCIpDVftg","stars_x":1.0,"date":1520111377000,"text":"This is a convenient Schnucks for me, but I did want to comment on how if you are not careful, you can buy things that are expiring the next day.

You can search for individual items, save favorites for future orders, review sale items and review previous orders.\n  \nI've checked out some of the other grocery delivery services in the area and this one seems to be the most reasonable, by far.  The fee generally ranges from $10-$15, plus tip for the driver. So, it's best to wait until you have lots to order, since the price doesn't fluctuate with the size of the order. You choose a store from their list that is closest to your home and you will know what the standard fee is before placing your order. It costs a bit more for same day delivery.","name":"Schnucks - Arsenal","address":"5055 Arsenal St","city":"Saint Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63139","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Alcohol":"'full_bar'","BusinessParking":"{'valet': False, 'garage': False, 'street': False, 'lot': True, 'validated': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","Caters":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}","GoodForKids":"False","BikeParking":"True","HasTV":"False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"False","ByAppointmentOnly":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","DogsAllowed":"False","NoiseLevel":"'average'","RestaurantsTableService":"False","OutdoorSeating":"None"},"categories":"Food Delivery Services, Shopping, Delis, Restaurants, Health & Medical, Drugstores, Bakeries, Florists, Grocery, Flowers & Gifts, Food, Pharmacy"},{"review_id":"-fwUQvJSNqfQtpJ-_ajdgw","business_id":"MEhkXOeLwdbSZgCIpDVftg","stars_x":1.0,"date":1432710582000,"text":"Just tried to call this location and after the automated answer saying \"Thank you for calling Schnucks\" it immediately hung up after each time I tried to call.

The BEST to all!!\n\nI started eating these meals in February, 2016 after I moved here from Texas. \nSince I really don't like to cook..these meals were the answer to my food God!!!!!! :o)) Even my family knew I was in Fit-Flavors heaven!!!!!\n\nFrom April, 2016..I started to use these meals pretty much on a full time basis. I still make some of my own breakfasts...yet would rather have some of their yummy meals!!! The best part about all these meals (other than the great taste!)...they have all the nutritional information on each container. How much easier can that get??? \nI've always been into fitness and nutrition. However...Fit-Flavors just made things so much better. I lost weight and felt great! I still wanted to know more about how to fit these foods in with an even better nutritional plan.\n\nAbout a month ago, I attended a free Cooler Chat session with the Dietitian, Allison Leskow. The topic was MyFitnessPal. Since I've used MyFitnessPal in the past..I wanted to get more information about how to better use it. \nAllison was great! She was very informative and as so nice! I was then curious about having these foods and using this device. She said that she can help set up a nutrition program incorporating the Fit-Flavors food. That was my main focus...so I set up some sessions with her. Allison set up my program using calories, as opposed to my previous programs with the breakdowns of macros. Yet with these foods...that information is already there...and it is so much easier to just do calories.\n\nMy results were almost immediate and it's only gotten better!! It has been sooooo easy to stay focused and on track with MyFitnessPal!!! I'll also set up a few meals ahead and then I don't even have to think about what to eat other than look at the device to see what is planned for each meal and snack. And the body knows when it's time to eat!!!! Trust me!!!!!!\n\nI can honestly say that at the age of 66...this is the best I have ever looked or felt! My clothes fit amazing and I'm at the lowest size and weight I have been in a very long time and it is due to the right amount of calories for my body. And...I will not be on that yo-yo track anymore. This is a great way of life!\nAnd....eating these pre-made Fit-Flavors foods has been one the best things to make this journey so successful. And the snacks can be some of those \"forbidden\" foods...yet...when tracked...they fit right in with the plan. Even if I go out to dinner...it's still easy to track food with the device...so ya never have to be away from your plan.\n\nI cannot go on any further without saying...Allison is the reason for helping me get to this fantastic place in my life!!! She is the Best!!!!\nYes....I am the one to do the work. However..she is the one who gave me the correct tools and direction!\nI just love her and appreciate how much she cares about her clients! And no matter how many clients she has...you and your success are very important to her.\nI would encourage anyone who wants to make changes and have true success..to contact Allison!!

The meat and seafood counters have a good selection. They have a larger variety of fresh baked breads than most Schnucks. The deli counter does not have Boar's Head meats, so you'll have to go elsewhere if you are looking for them. \n\nI do enjoy going to the shops on the Hill, but this Schnucks is a good alternative. You don't have to worry about parking, the prices are far more reasonable, and you can finish all of your shopping in one trip.\n\nBetween the olive bar, specialty italian cheeses, and friendly cashiers, this Schnucks location has won me over.

It isn't usually as crowded and the produce seems fresher to me.  I also like the little Italian section.  But I have a few problems with it.\n\nThey recently stopped carrying stuff that I buy regularly.  Where are the Skippy peanut butter, Planter's honey roasted peanuts, and hamburger in 2lb packages?  And for a while they weren't carrying the snack size Edy's real fruit bars that I like, but I did see them again on my last trip.  I really wish they carried Haagen Dazs tropical fruit sorbet like the Schnucks in Columbia, MO.\n\nAlso, the cashiers and baggers are friendly but sometimes are too friendly with each other, carrying on a whole conversation with each other and not paying attention to the fact that a can of soup should not be thrown on top of a bunch of bananas.  I even tried to put the things on the conveyor belt in an order that would be good for bagging.  It didn't work.  Although, a trick that I learned recently after getting quite tired of the inattentive bagging is to use the reusable bags.  (I have some I got elsewhere and purchased a few from Schnucks when they were on sale.)  The baggers pay more attention to bagging when you use those bags.  They also tend to pack them until they're full, which I also like because it means fewer bags to carrying in the house.\n\nAnd, while it isn't as crowded, it can be just as tedious when the little old ladies come out.  I have no idea what was going on, but when I went a few weeks ago there were old ladies everywhere, standing in the middle of the aisles and not hearing me when I said excuse me to try to walk around them.","name":"Schnucks - Arsenal","address":"5055 Arsenal St","city":"Saint Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63139","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Alcohol":"'full_bar'","BusinessParking":"{'valet': False, 'garage': False, 'street': False, 'lot': True, 'validated': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","Caters":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}","GoodForKids":"False","BikeParking":"True","HasTV":"False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"False","ByAppointmentOnly":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","DogsAllowed":"False","NoiseLevel":"'average'","RestaurantsTableService":"False","OutdoorSeating":"None"},"categories":"Food Delivery Services, Shopping, Delis, Restaurants, Health & Medical, Drugstores, Bakeries, Florists, Grocery, Flowers & Gifts, Food, Pharmacy"},{"review_id":"cEVYfxvYMzXYCW0qWKYCPA","business_id":"JGVcrMpcaK6Wk0SEJLMx7w","stars_x":5.0,"date":1409866363000,"text":"Today I stopped in to check this place out, after my mom told me about it.

I started doing orders with Fit-Flavors in February of this year. I wanted to get back into meal prepping and wanted to be mindful of low calorie\/low carb meals in order to lose weight, and stumbled upon Fit-Flavors. I like that the food is already prepared and only needs to be reheated in the microwave for minimal time. The prices aren't bad, about the same that you'd pay at a restaurant if not a little less, and on average in the $10-$13 range per person\/per meal. They offer free delivery for STL metro customers for orders over $70 or $75. That's easy to get to when you're buying meals for a whole week. You can also go to the store and pick up meals as you go and just put them in the freezer or heat them up that day. The food only lasts 5 days in the freezer.\n\nSome of the meals are hit or miss on flavor so there is a bit of trial and error that goes into finding what food you like, but most of the options are really tasty. My personal favorites are the spaghetti squash with marinara and meatballs, the buffalo chicken tenders\/nuggets, the Greek salad, blackened salmon, the oatmeal with mixed berries, and the steak with Yukon potatoes. My least favorite meal so far was the turkey meatloaf. The texture and taste just weren't it, at all. \n\nI also can proudly say that while doing Fit-Flavors for dinner only for 10 days out of a month (5 nights every other week), I did lose weight during those weeks, so I've been successful doing Fit-Flavors. If you're wanting to meal prep or just want to pick up dinner that is already portion controlled and has the nutrition facts of the entire meal indicated, I highly recommend Fit-Flavors!","name":"Fit-Flavors","address":"14842 Clayton Rd","city":"Chesterfield","state":"MO","postal_code":"63017","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":33,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","AcceptsInsurance":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","HappyHour":"False","DogsAllowed":"False","Alcohol":"u'none'","HasTV":"True","BusinessAcceptsBitcoin":"False","OutdoorSeating":"True","DriveThru":"True","ByAppointmentOnly":"False","WheelchairAccessible":"True","Caters":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"False","WiFi":"u'free'","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2"},"categories":"Food, Dietitians, Health Markets, Fast Food, Vegetarian, Health & Medical, Restaurants, Event Planning & Services, Caterers, Fruits & Veggies, Specialty Food, Nutritionists, Food Delivery Services, Gluten-Free"},{"review_id":"tbjx9HIxEfnvQIBArm5paA","business_id":"MEhkXOeLwdbSZgCIpDVftg","stars_x":3.0,"date":1593792627000,"text":"Does anyone remember when Schnucks had quality products?

I went in weary, because my friend who recommended it eats, what I consider to be, gross healthy food. But, I decided to try it about a month or so ago and I'm hooked, and have gotten half my office hooked!  \n\nOn the surface, it may seem kind of pricy, but when I really broke it down, it wasn't too bad. I spend about $50 for my week of lunches. When I was meal prepping, I would spend about $30. But, for $30\/week it meant I had to (1) spend about 3-4 hours of my Sunday afternoon making lunch for the week, and then cleaning up, (2) I had to eat the exact same thing every day, and (3) by Wednesday or Thursday I was bored with my lunch, would throw it out, and go spend money on unhealthy food at a restaurant for the rest of the week, effectively spending more than $50 in total for the week. Now that I've found Fit-Flavors, I pick up 5 lunches for the week, get to eat something different everyday, don't have to clean anything up, and get consistently delicious food!\n\nFor breakfast, my favorite is the Carne con Huevos. The small version keeps me more than full until lunch. I've started buying the large because it actually gives me two days of breakfast, and still keeps me full. (Note that I usually eat A LOT, so the fact that this stuff keeps me full is amazing.). For lunch, right now, I really like the Grass-fed burger with mango salsa, and the Memphis rubbed steak tips. I add a little hot sauce to my burger and it's perfect, and my steak tips are super flavorful the way they are. One of my co-workers mentioned that some of the food didn't have enough flavor to it, but she added some salt and then fell I love. Remember, it's super easy to add salt (or hot sauce) to a dish - impossible to remove it. So it makes sense for the (healthy, mind you) dishes to be low on sodium. Just add some and you're golden. \n\nI recently started trying the snacks. The granola bars are probably my favorite.  They're filling, and have a good amount of protein in them - double perk. \n\nSo, if you're looking for an EASY way to eat healthy...you need to check this place out!!!  You won't regret it!

Because their food is SO good!\n\nThe original brick and mortar Seoul Taco location in the Delmar Loop was always such a pain for me to get to, so I actually never had food from that location.

While you can still find their food around town at food truck rallies, the idea of it being so easily accessible on Manchester was the stuff dreams are made of!\n\nOrdering from Seoul Taco is so simple. Their online system is a breeze. We actually ordered inside with an incredibly pleasant employee though. The food was hot and ready in just a few minutes. (Ordering and getting fresh food is really something that I've missed during the pandemic.) Because it was a Friday in Lent, we went with completely meatless options. My boyfriend chose the tofu quesadilla and I went for the burrito (we had a coupon for a free taco too!) \n\nThe quesadilla was full of gooey cheese and oozed flavor. The rice in my burrito packed a spicy punch, but wasn't unenjoyable. Loved the fried rice inside the burrito, but would have liked there to be a little more sauce.

Called prior to ordering online to ask what WHET includes on the burritos and either the gent didn't want to tell me or didn't know because he hung up.  Undeterred, I ordered online.  Pick up (drive thru) was just plain odd.  Text\/email said food was ready so I get into the drive thru lane and wait for 5 minutes for the car in front of me to get their order.  Once at the drive thru window I have to wait another 5 minutes for my food order.  While waiting, you get a great view of the kitchen staff doing their stuff which doesn't give me much confidence in a great outcome.  2 stars for the lead up to dinner.\nCarbon Burrito (still have no idea what WHET includes) was very good but I was hungry so a shoe may have tasted fine.  I would try it again.  Bacon pizza was great, certainly hit the mark here according to kid #1.  Wife enjoyed her Rico salad w\/chicken.  Kid #2 had a  Carbon quesadilla which I finished off as leftovers the next day.  That was pretty tasty! For the actual food I'd give it 3.5 stars. Pricey for a drive thru.  \nOverall review rounds up to 3 stars\nLocation is great but also a curse. The night I picked up, people waiting for their orders blocked much of the ingress\/egress which made the drive thru challenging.

The place was clean, pretty full, and really loud and rowdy. Noise just bounces from the floor to the ceiling, to the wooden tables\/chairs\/booths. I couldn't hear myself talking to my sister on the phone, who also said \"where are you because it's really loud?\" \n\nTo give a quick rundown of the food and my cocktail: the bourbon cocktail I had was excellent! The burger was trying to be on the same level of Shake Shack and doesn't compare. It was bland and basic. Read my experience below for more details on that. The fries are essentially McDonalds fries. Would you pay $13.75 to get McDonalds fries and a lesser version of Shake Shack burger? \n\nThe service was fair but friendly. My waitress suggested that I go with one of their regular menu burgers instead of the $6 Burger Week burger because she said it's really small. I was starving so I agreed. I ordered the King Burger with fries and a bourbon cocktail (the one with mint, simple syrup, and lemon juice, sorry I can't remember the name). \n\nI got my food really fast, like rocket speed, but it was missing onions which was noted on the menu and my waitress directly told me that \"raw onions\" come on the burger. I looked throughout my burger and found no onions. I flagged my waitress and told her. She apologized and said she'd go get some, and confirmed if I wanted raw or grilled onions. I replied that I wanted raw. She turns to walk away and 10 seconds later turns back saying that she thinks she sees them on the bottom of my burger. Honey, I've looked and there are none. She stood there and basically had me dissect my double patty burger, ripping the patties apart tearing the cheese up all to show her YET AGAIN, THAT THERE ARE NO ONIONS ON THE BURGER. She then walked away to go get them. Why did she come back less than a minute later with grilled onions saying \"I brought you grilled onions because they taste better.\" Ma'am, I asked for raw. I accepted the grilled, which legit tasted like White Castle onions. They did absolutely nothing for the burger, and I think the raw, as designated on the menu for this burger would have been a much better choice, which was my choice in fact, but I did not complain.\n\nBy this point, I was ready to go. They offer basic desserts including snowballs and ice cream, but my experience and the loud noise kept me from wanting to endure this experience any longer. The cocktail is the only redeeming value of my experience as it was exceptionally good, but everything else was subpar from other dining experiences in the near vicinity or greater metro area. This place seems to be confused on what it's trying to be. It has the appearance of a family friendly restaurant with its bright colors and cheerful demeanor, but with a bar, and with loud ambiance. It kind of seems like it's trying to be a kid-friendly sports bar and grill, which you can just do Applebee's, Buffalo Wild Wings, etc. for that. It's too much and not enough at the same time.","name":"The Parkmoor","address":"220 W Lockwood Ave","city":"Webster Groves","state":"MO","postal_code":"63119","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":46,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","RestaurantsTableService":"True","GoodForKids":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","WiFi":"u'free'","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","BYOB":"False","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","DogsAllowed":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","WheelchairAccessible":"True","Caters":"True","HasTV":"True"},"categories":"American (Traditional), Breakfast & Brunch, Burgers, Food, Desserts, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"8NBr7tY1Gw4flfmtyNpcQA","business_id":"_kvfdSVhVG4F0I3lNIbpaA","stars_x":5.0,"date":1623592782000,"text":"A family favorite!

Worth a stop in.\n\nI've been to the Delmar location a bunch, but technically this new location is closer...by like a minute.  That's one less minute I have to wait to get that food in my belly!  This is the second time I've been to the new location on Chouteau.  So I'm going to combine.  Both times I ordered pickup on their website and both times I got the chicken burrito.  I always get the chicken burrito, why mess with perfection?!  The burrito is amazing.  It's huge, lil sweet, lil savory, lil spicy.  It's got kimchi fried rice, lettuce, cheese, shredded carrots, green onion, sour cream, and Seoul sauce (not sure what it is, but it rivals Boss sauce...if you know, you know).  I'm not a kimchi person but I really like how they do it, so don't let that sway you away if you're like me.  My total was about $10 and change.  The only difference between the two visits was the pickup process.  The first time, I showed up at my pickup time and everyone and their mother must have ordered at the same time.  They were running behind by about 15-20 minutes, which was apologetically communicated to me.  It was Friday night and I had nothing to rush off to, so I just popped back outside (because people are gross right now) and waited.  After about 15 minutes I went back in and they were still working on orders.  Total I think I waited about 25 minutes.  The staff were a bit frazzled, but they were still pleasant.  I would say this was a freak anomaly.  This time, I popped in early Sunday evening.  I was actually late, so everything was ready to go.  From the signage I could see, I didn't know what the pickup process was and I told the cashier that I had a pickup order and my name.  I felt like this annoyed the guy working the cashier.  To prevent you from making my error, walk in on the Manchester side, bypass the cashier area and go to the back where you see a line of tables.  They do the pickup orders back there.  The guy back there was very nice and I walked out and went home to gorge myself.

My visit for lunch today was therefore not an exercise in nostalgia, but a search for a clean, comfortable, casual, friendly and reasonably priced restaurant serving what has come to be called \"comfort food\" - great hamburgers, sandwiches, salads, etc.  \nThe Parkmoor certainly checks all the boxes on the first three factors - clean, yes (although some of the servers masks failed to cover noses or mouths); casual (yes, with colorful but somewhat plain looking wooden chairs, tables and booths inside); and service was efficient and friendly, certainly as to our personable waitress and the waiter we frequently overheard.\nReasonably priced?  Well, I'll give them that too, as while prices seemed a touch high on the menu, portions were fairly large and many patrons, ourselves included, took home a loaded to-go box from the tall and long entrees (e.g., a fried baloney sandwich served on two grilled cheese sandwiches).\nBut great comfort food?  Sorry, not to my taste.  Mediocre or average at best, to be kind. \nThe Philly cheesesteak, described on the menu as \"slow roasted beef griddled with green peppers, caramelized onions, giardiniera (pickled vegetables), finished with melted provolone and liquid gold cheese sauce\" was seemingly composed of Arby's roast beef with few green pepper fragment, no onions (but instead a bevy of garlic cloves - same color?), three slivers of pickled carrots (which ain't giardiniera in Chicago or Philly, as far as I know) with two slices of provolone and a cheese sauce not unlike the radioactive, non-perishable cheese sauce often found on movie or sporting event nachos.  I derived little true comfort from this cheesesteak.  (P.S. - fries were very salty and not very hot.)\nMy advice - go for the nostalgia, but ... eat the entrees only if you need to invoke the good ole memories.

My former coworker, Lucas, and I like to periodically catch up over lunch. We usually have to meet in Webster Groves as it is kind of the middle point between his new office and my (home) office. The Parkmoor's bold presence on the web definitely sets it apart from other lunch spots and caught our interest for one of our lunchtime pow-wows. \n\nFinding the The Parkmoor is super simple. It's located on the bustling business district portion of Lockwood. I easily found on street parking, but had to dodge a few cars going a tad too fast for such a pedestrian heavy locale. \n\nThe retro interior of The Parkmoor is so engaging. Bold colors. Strong lines. And a subtle sports theme. The restaurant had a vibrant energy that lent itself to a jovial meeting with Lucas! Additionally, our waitress was such a gem. She was polite and not pushy. Definitely added to the feel-good vibes of The Parkmoor. \n\nI will be the first to admit that I'm not the biggest burger person. They're fine. I just never get excited about them. EEEEEEESpecially when they're served on brioche. Ok. So I hate brioche buns. It is objectively the actual worst bread out there. Dryer than saltines. For YEARS I've voiced my displeasure with restaurants touting this garbage excuse of a carb as a high end bread. It's trash. stop using it everywhere. Please. I was a bit bummed that the menu at The Parkmoor didn't clearly identify the bun as brioche, but simply a buttered bun. Had I known I would have ordered something else. But I made it work. Slather enough ketchup on a brioche bun and it'll pass. The actual flavors of my mushroom swiss burger were really good. The mushrooms were tender and added a little extra heft to the smash patties.\n\nSince this lunch was pre-2022 and I wasn't really paying attention to what I was eating, I started the meal with a bowl of their gumbo. The bowl was massive and definitely enough for a meal! I appreciated the selection of hot sauces The Parkmoor offered. I would absolutely get the gumbo again.\n\nExcited to visit The Parkmoor again during the summer to try one of their New Orleans style sno cones.

Now I remind you we only had two sandwiches so I'm not says all their sandwiches tasted the same only the two we had....\n\nAnywho I was impressed that our food stayed warm cause we had a ways to travel about 20 mins or more.

The fam and I decided to stop by here for a Friday night dinner. While the fam ordered burgers, I stepped out on the wild side and ordered the liver and onions. \nIt comes with two side, so I opted for vegetable beef soup and home fries. \nThe soup wasn't anything special. I'm going to assume that it was beef stock, some canned carrots, and potatoes. The down side to the soup was that is only had one piece of beef. I just happened to have pictured it. \nI was more impressed with the liver and onions and home fries. \nPerfectly cooked and full of flavor. It have a great crust on it that tasted of pepper. The onions were perfectly cooked which complemented the liver perfectly. To top off the liver and onions, was a perfectly flavored brown gravy. I could have drank it by the cup full. But I held back for fear of embarrassing the fam (I've been known to do that in the past). \nThe home fries were large cubed potatoes which were deep fried ( and we know everything tastes better fried) and seasoned perfectly with what seemed like pepper and salt and some other hidden spice\nReally there were two downsides to this place, one was the vegetable beef soup, the other was it was way too dark in the place. While I understand you want to set the ambience, the lack of light made me feel like were eating in a cave. \nOverall I found this place to be really nice and am willing to try it again and update my review.

Regardless, I don't like ho's\/hoes; they annoy me because they think I'm really that shallow to tip them more than normal because of their big boobs\/ exposed thong\/ pierced belly button. Show me a place with ho's, and I'll show you a place without me (I know--its inversely related to \"College Me.\"). \n\nAnyway, so I finally take the step, literally, into D's Place, and what do you know? No ho's\/hoes! In fact, there were no servers at all!\n\nWhen we walked in three guys said hi to us--and not like, \"what's up, fellow bar patron,\" but more like \"hello, and welcome to D's.\" I thought the first two were employees, so I was going to ask if there were servers, or if we simply went up to the bar--but then they left. When the third came by our table and saluted us in the same manner, I simply ignored him, thinking he too was just another customer, but then he asked us if we'd been helped. \n\nJesus, I suck at this game. \n\nSo the waitress\/bartender finally comes over for our order--which takes forever to get, and when we asked for menus, she brought them over and didn't come back for 15 minutes. Redonkulous. \n\nAnyway, the most important thing: drinks here--that is, domestic beer and well drinks--are ALWAYS $2. And these aren't served in rocks glasses (for the drinks), they're served in PINT glasses. Also, for you bartenders\/drunks out there, its not a tall, its an actual double pour pint glass. \n\nSo, to recap: crappy service (at least on a Wednesday evening), $2 Big Boy cocktails. WINNER!\n\nThis place is a serious dive bar. Its the place where you go after playing pick up basketball with your friends because you don't care what you look like.

When I arrived, I could tell from the outside it was a dive. Then when I entered, I smiled even more. I was a true dive bar. Or as Eric N.  said, in his ROTD, it is as close to \"your neighborhood watering hole\" as it can get. The proof was as I sat at the bar enjoying my lunch, all the other patrons greeted each other by name. That's a true neighborhood bar. \n\nMy biggest dilemma was should I order wings or a burger. After getting recommendation from the bartender, I choose to go wings. Especially after I found out, I could choose two different flavors in one order. I went with my favorite, Lemon & Pepper and a bar favorite, Garlic Parmesan.\n\nWhen ordering wings, I am a stickler for my order having the same amount of flats and drums. D's impressed me, they not only gave me the same amount of flats and drums in my order, they also made sure each flavor had the same amount. \n\nMy wing pieces were good in size and fried to a crispy crunch. Being a true fan of Lemon & Pepper, it was my favorite. I love the tang of lemon and kick of pepper. I can see why their Garlic & Parmesan is a bar favorite. However, I would not recommend them on a date night. I say that with a smile, because they're garlic flavor as good as it was, it was strong. I guess if you share the order, with your date all would be good. (smile)\n\nI was not impressed with the fries that I had as a side with my wings. I'm super picky about my fries and don't care for the type that are seasonally coated. I heard their onion rings are good, so when I come back to experience the, Hell Fire Burger that has fried jalape\u00c3\u00b1os on it (another favorite of mine) I'll order onion rings as my side. \n\nService was dive bar friendly. The bartender called all the other guest by their name. Not knowing mine, she just called me, \"Babe\" when she checked on me frequently. With only a single bartender covering the entire bar and tables, the service was attentive. \n\nI'll be back? - Hell Fire Burger is calling my name. \n\nWhen: September 11, 2019\nWhy: 9-4-19 ROTD on Yelp","name":"D's Place","address":"900 Barton St","city":"Saint Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63104","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":49,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","WiFi":"u'free'","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","GoodForKids":"False","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': True, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BusinessAcceptsBitcoin":"False","NoiseLevel":"'average'","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","OutdoorSeating":"True","HasTV":"True","Caters":"False","HappyHour":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': True, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"},"categories":"Burgers, Bars, American (Traditional), Nightlife, Pizza, Chicken Wings, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"ArpGQ6XIeT-yEUqm0N4pug","business_id":"aePpEsIT6LzGuNDjS5U0Ag","stars_x":1.0,"date":1583110408000,"text":"A fantastic pub with great folks but I still ask why they felt they needed to bring an army to cast out a 30 year Marine.

I guess like they say, never judge a book by its cover! \n\nWe are trying our best to support the local bars and restaurants in our new neighborhood as the lucrative summer months wane.

Since we didn't have plans for dinner, I suggested trying D's. \n\nI'm giving D's a four star rating because of customer service. When I called in to place my order, the employee was very grumpy and not helpful. I simply asked how many slices were in a 10-inch pizza. (We were having a friend over for dinner as well, so I wanted to make sure we had plenty.) Because this was my first ever time trying D's food, I had no context of size or slice count. The person on the other side of the telephone threw me a little attitude saying \"it's square cut. I don't know how many pieces it makes.\" Well then. Just the info about it being square cut slices was enough to give me an idea of how much I needed to offer. I would give D's a three because of the worker's curtness with me, but actually in these type of situations, it makes the Soulard bar feel more authentic. So hey. Great work creating a real dive bar vibe! (But maybe be a little nicer.)\n\nThe menu is pretty on par for what you'd expect for a local bar. Standard items like salads, wings, and sandwiches. I did appreciate the interesting specialty pizzas. When you have thin crust pizza, you might as well dress it up with something exotic! We took the gamble on the Spicy Special, described as Hot sauce, bacon, hamburger & cheddar jack cheese. I impulse bought the Cheesesteak pizza because it just sounded interesting with Pizza sauce topped with saut\u00c3\u00a9ed roast beef, onion, green pepper and pizza cheese. Both pizzas had a lot of flavor. The crust was crunchy with an every so slight doughy texture. And they were even better cold the next day. I would consider going back soon just to put a pie in the fridge overnight for breakfast!","name":"D's Place","address":"900 Barton St","city":"Saint Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63104","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":49,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","WiFi":"u'free'","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","GoodForKids":"False","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': True, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BusinessAcceptsBitcoin":"False","NoiseLevel":"'average'","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","OutdoorSeating":"True","HasTV":"True","Caters":"False","HappyHour":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': True, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}"},"categories":"Burgers, Bars, American (Traditional), Nightlife, Pizza, Chicken Wings, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"uZFoF9jsx4sp3vuaQ1DdqA","business_id":"H_T1u5hL5HwH-XR9oZqYYg","stars_x":1.0,"date":1617711314000,"text":"Cant rate it a zero and wanted to give an update.

My first time there the waitress I believe her name was Jessica super nice to us gave some great suggestions for food and always followed up during a busy happy hour time. Everything we had was super fresh and tasted well. The buffalo chicken wontons are a must and if you're in a crowd you might want to order more than one appetizer! The white pizza actually comes with chicken on it see if you can substitute chicken for sausage. I added sausage to it but I think it would've liked it better without chicken either way it was good. Fried pickle chips are perfect and the crust stays on them pretty good unlike other places. The burger we ordered was a little dry so maybe next time order a medium to make sure they don't over cook it. However this would not stop me from returning.  I do look forward to enjoying their patio during the war months because the only downside is the dining room side is extremely loud and it's hard to talk\/hear even when you're next to someone. I'm hoping to also try the bar side of the pub next time hoping it's not as loud. It definitely has a local vibe but like I said the waitress was very welcoming and everybody seem like they were just having a great time without any snobbery ... that's what makes Sue lard so great.

It's on the more costly end of fast food restaurants, but the taste of the chicken far outstrips other fast food places, and even most sit-down restaurants! Their chicken is not over processed chicken product, but great cuts of real chicken breast, lightly but flavorfully breaded & juicy (Now I'm hungry). They also have some of the BEST lemonade and when I used to work nearby, I would often take home a gallon jug to keep at home (just be on the lookout for seeds, this is the real deal). Also, (a college friend turned me on to this), mix the honey mustard with a packet of mayo to dip the waffle fries in...it's life affirmingly good. They also serve breakfast, but I have yet to try it as they don't have one close to my home (almost a reason to move).\n\nThey are closed on Sunday so their workers can have the day to devote to their families and the Lord. While this can be disappointing when I'm out on a Sunday, I respect that they're not only standing by their beliefs, but also making sure their employees can have a decent family life. It just makes me like them more.\n\nRecommended Items:\nChicken Sandwich (breaded chicken breast+toasted bun+pickles = delish)\nNuggets (also dip in Honey Mustard\/Mayo mixture!)\nGrilled Chicken Sandwich (I prefer grilled everywhere but here, but it's still good!)\nChicken Salad Sandwich\nGrilled Chicken Cool Wrap\nHearty Breast of Chicken Soup (almost like homemade, FANTASTIC when you're ill)\nWaffle Potato Fries (mmmm)\nFruit Cup (it's fresh fruit, not some junk in syrup, so yummy)\nLEMONADE!!!","name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"10706 Sunset Hills Plz","city":"Saint Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63127","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":42,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BikeParking":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","OutdoorSeating":"True","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","NoiseLevel":"'loud'","RestaurantsTableService":"False","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': None, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","Caters":"True","DriveThru":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': True, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': True}","BYOB":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","WiFi":"'free'","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","Alcohol":"'none'","WheelchairAccessible":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","GoodForKids":"True"},"categories":"Caterers, Restaurants, Chicken Wings, Chicken Shop, Fast Food, Event Planning & Services"},{"review_id":"bpIbjeCiewpG0bTC53QHsA","business_id":"IzzPfs4k3HYGKjTfkZdzsw","stars_x":5.0,"date":1497913817000,"text":"clean friendly and very fast.   i love the food   it was great going to  fast food that tasted great had a clean place to eat and people who where friendly and did not have the blank stare at you","name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"10706 Sunset Hills Plz","city":"Saint Louis","state":"MO","postal_code":"63127","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":42,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BikeParking":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","OutdoorSeating":"True","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","NoiseLevel":"'loud'","RestaurantsTableService":"False","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': None, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","Caters":"True","DriveThru":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': True, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': True, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': True}","BYOB":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","WiFi":"'free'","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","Alcohol":"'none'","WheelchairAccessible":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","GoodForKids":"True"},"categories":"Caterers, Restaurants, Chicken Wings, Chicken Shop, Fast Food, Event Planning & Services"},{"review_id":"4rxOmd0MPeF4FN_DjF296A","business_id":"IzzPfs4k3HYGKjTfkZdzsw","stars_x":4.0,"date":1507148553000,"text":"I normally avoid fast food but Chick-fil-A is the exception.

There were many more taco options, some of which I will be trying soon...maybe not the cow tongue but hey, there is something for everyone.
