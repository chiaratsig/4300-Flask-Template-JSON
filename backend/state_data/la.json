I had eaten at Smiley's many times over the years and their food had always been very good.  One of my sister's got there at 7:30pm.  The rest of us were on our way.  She texted us and said she was seated and that she was told we would be the last table seated as they had a wedding in the back room at 8:00pm.  The rest of us arrived at 7:35pm and saw numerous people entering the restaurant in dress clothes.  We felt uncomfortable as though we were intruding on this couple's wedding and voiced that concern to the waitress who assured us we were fine to stay and order.  There were three other tables seated in the restaurant.  Before we ordered the bride and groom entered which made us feel even more uncomfortable and I didn't know how we would be sitting at tables next to wedding guests and eating our dinner.  We ordered quickly so as to hurry and get out of the way and I wish now that we had just left so as not to intrude on the private wedding party.  One of the two waitresses brought the table a basket of garlic french bread which was very good.  I ordered a seafood gumbo and stuffed mushroom and the rest of the table ordered chicken parmesan.  The gumbo had a good color and 5 or 6 (21\/25 count) shrimp but it had NO flavor.  The stuffed mushroom appetizer had 4 mushrooms.  The mushrooms were stuffed then breaded and fried and covered with what I believe was supposed to be some kind of mayonaisse sauce but it was very lacking.  I could not taste anything but mayonaisse so I can't say whether the mushrooms were good or not as I only ate a couple of bites because I couldn't get past the taste of mayonaisse.  The chicken in the chicken parmesan was tough and the two people who ordered it did not eat it. We quickly paid the bill which was brought to the table before we even got the food but the waitress did say there was no hurry.  The twenty minutes we were there guests continued to pile into the restaurant and sit at tables around us while other staff passed hors d'oeuvres to them, other guests lined up at the bar for drinks and a band began to play as the bride and groom began their first dance as husband and wife.  I wish I could have apologized to the couple and their guests for intruding on their special occasion.  Seating regular diners within 25-30 minutes of a private function commencing was a mistake of the management who made that decision.  However, worse than that decision was the food.  I don't think I will ever give it a another chance.  I guess in the time it took to transition from Smiley's to Augie's the chef's who were preparing the delicious food found new jobs elsewhere.","name":"Augie's Restaurant","address":"6005 Jefferson Hwy","city":"Harahan","state":"LA","postal_code":"70123","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":32,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsReservations":"True","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': True, 'divey': False, 'intimate': True, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","BikeParking":"True","OutdoorSeating":"False","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","WiFi":"u'free'","RestaurantsTableService":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","WheelchairAccessible":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Caters":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': False, u'lot': None, u'validated': False}","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","GoodForKids":"True","HasTV":"True","Music":"{u'dj': False, u'live': True, u'jukebox': False, u'video': False, u'background_music': False, u'karaoke': False, u'no_music': False}"},"categories":"Seafood, Italian, Restaurants, American (Traditional), Nightlife, Cocktail Bars, Bars"},{"review_id":"UFfc2S-vlwGZfP7xwKorgQ","business_id":"qFfxWon_Rx99KF4rHViMkQ","stars_x":5.0,"date":1452130122000,"text":"Excellent service & the flavor is 5 stars!\n\nDo you need a place that fits your taste?

Tonight I ordered the shrimp and broccoli combination dinner with egg roll and pork fried rice. Very delicious for the reasonable price. The egg roll was tasty (be sure to take a packet of the duck sauce and a packet of mustard for the egg roll.) The shrimps were large and tender and the broccoli was tender-crisp with a tasty sauce. The fried rice was very good and the portions are always large. Although I've had better Chinese food, I really think that this place is a good, healthy alternative to a burger and fries at an incredibly reasonable price and that's why I'm giving it 5 stars.

The kids were begging for pizza, and not generally much of a pizza fan, particularly in New Orleans, I decided to order a meatball sub for me and a pizza margherita for the kids. The sub was amazing. Meatballs were nearly all meat with very little filler but moist. Tangy sauce and the bread.... Now onto the pizza, as I said not much of a pizza fan since Ive been in the south, but OMG did this pizza bring me back to the family owned neighborhood pizzerias on Long Island. The kids \"gavoned\" the pie, leaving me a sliver. That mere sliver transported me back in time. Thin, crispy, yet chewy crust with just the right amount of char. The tangy but sweet sauce with the mozz and basil, an absolute hit. Had I known by then, I would have ordered two pies!!!

The pictures posted are of a fruit bowl- Dat Fiya Pitaya, and 2 vegan muffins-a Chantilly and a blueberry. I also bought a fresh pressed juice- carrot- which I could clearly tell wasn't cut with anything. I could taste the ginger, which I appreciated. The place was full the whole time and the line was to the door most of the time, so be prepared to wait because majority of the items are freshly prepared, which is obviously a good thing. \n\nAlso, major key- {DJ Khaled voice} the man who I believed to be the owner continuously acknowledged the line, saying that someone would be with them shortly. This constant acknowledgement clearly showed that he appreciated his customers. He also pulled someone from the back to replace him at the register, and in turn started helping his staff prepare orders when the line got really long. I particularly value quality customer service equally to a good product, so those observations were huge plusses for me. I will definitely be a repeat customer. \n\nP.S.

Yes.\n\nIt's a cute little spot with some seating. Great selection of empanadas featuring local flavors. I got the two vegan flavors that they had; the yellow curry and the impossible. It's served with sauces, the two vegan ones are hot sauce and chimichurri. I liked the impossible better than the curry. The crust is a bit soft, not flaky. The impossible had a deep flavor, it may be too salty for some people. The yellow curry was actually really good and would go really well with a bowl of rice.\n\nIf I'm shopping in the area I would definitely stop for a little snack.","name":"Empanola","address":"3109 Magazine St","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70115","stars_y":5.0,"review_count":34,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': None, u'street': True, u'lot': False, u'validated': False}","NoiseLevel":"u'average'"},"categories":"Soup, Empanadas, Latin American, Salad, Restaurants, Food"},{"review_id":"NTEzP3Fcwm6qtQlpsgVdBA","business_id":"CEtW6hZfqqd888WFdxv2lw","stars_x":5.0,"date":1640380247000,"text":"Delicious lunch here today.

The little empanada shop is spacious with a casual vibe. The Christmas tree in the window is cute!  When you walk in, you can see all of the empanadas displayed in a glass box, and each one is baked fresh upon ordering. You always know you'll get a freshly baked treat. I also love that they have SO many flavors and about 5 vegetarian options. I think they have a few extras that are not listed online as well.\n\nI tried 7 different flavors and they were all FANTASTIC!! Seriously delicious!! Each empanada is about the size of your palm with plenty of filling in every single one!  No skimping on the best parts (the filling, obviously) with these! I would say eating 3 or 4 is enough to fill you up for a meal, so the portion is fair! Especially for being located on a hoppin' popular street like Magazine, the empanadas and the desserts at Empanola are VERY reasonably priced! Not expensive for what you get at all!\n\nI also bought a few extra sauces to try, but in all honestly, the empanadas are flavorful enough on their own, that you don't really need the sauces. However, that being said, the cilantro lime sauce and the chumichuri sauce (blend of oil, herbs, spices, and garlic) were really yummy. I put it on the \"crusts\" of my empanadas after I ate all the parts with filling in them!\n\nI was able to pick out 3 to try complimentary with my Yelp Elite Perk, but I also purchased 4 extras to try. I had the:\n\n*Crawfish Etouffee ($4.75) - Amazing, just what you would expect. Very \"New-Orleans-y\"\n*Gumbo ($3.75) - I would prefer it to be a little runnier and zestier, but still really good! *Shrimp and cheese ($3.75) - Creamy and delicious\n*Chicken Peruvian ($3.75) - Flavorful and perfect\n*Mushroom and cheese ($3.75) - Fabulous, just what I wanted as a mushroom lover\n*Yellow curry ($3.75) - This one was a little but bland, but still yummy! (Keep in mind, I have high standards for curry though, since I'm used to eating great curries due to my boyfriend being Nepali and an amazing cook!)\n*\"Impossible\" empanada - Fantastic!! (This is the same as their Beef Argentina, but using the vegetarian \"Impossible burger meat\" instead.)\n\nI also got to try their alfajores complimentary with the Yelp Perk. The alfajores is a traditional Argentinian cookie, but the ones at Empanola have a New Orleans praline twist.

Pizza would get 2 stars. For some reason I never noticed this place tucked into the corner of a strip mall on Williams Blvd. I went in to grab a menu but they don't have printed menus because I was told prices vary often.  All you get to look at are the circular flyers to view pizza options. Not knowing how much something costs before ordering did not sit well with me. There are a few, maybe 4, tables inside. they have a beer cooler and there is an adjoining bar if you wish to carry in.  This must be a 100% delivery service because the place was empty at 7pm on a Friday. Order at the counter and they bring it to you with paper plates. It was eerily quiet.  First I must explain that this is a National Chain. It is the only location in Louisiana. There is a choice of dough, one made in-house which is supposed to be thinner. And one franchise dough. We ordered the in-house but it was still pretty puffy, sort of like Rotollo's. We ordered pepperoni, ground beef, Canadian bacon and mushrooms. The pepperoni was bland. The ground beef was very well done with dry crumbles sprinkled on top. The Canadian bacon and mushrooms were diced into TINY uniform cubes and sprinkled on top. I assume the toppings are frozen franchise products and wonder how the heck they cube the toppings so tiny and perfect? This gave the pizza an almost gritty texture. There wasn't much sauce to taste so I can't comment on it.  I never heard of Mr. Jim's pizza and really wanted to like the place since the new owners are a mom and pop operation and were really friendly and I wanted to support them. Sadly the pizza fell into the bottom 25% of my pizza experiences. And not knowing what it may cost is a big turn off. I hope they do well, but unfortunately I can't support the operation.","name":"MrJims.Pizza - Kenner","address":"2424 Williams Blvd., Suite E","city":"Kenner","state":"LA","postal_code":"70062","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":23,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsDelivery":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","WiFi":"u'no'","Alcohol":"u'beer_and_wine'","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","OutdoorSeating":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","BikeParking":"False","HappyHour":"False","GoodForKids":"True","HasTV":"False","BusinessAcceptsBitcoin":"False","Caters":"False","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True"},"categories":"Restaurants, Pizza"},{"review_id":"uYKvHg05d52EWQLYo9Rw7g","business_id":"0LhSxEtArvcr5CcOqR5txA","stars_x":5.0,"date":1559842731000,"text":"Mr.Jim's is under new ownership now but better than ever!

I should of known I was in trouble when the person on the phone asked for my phone number three times before getting it right. I inquired about a delivery charge and was told it only applied to orders under $15.00. I went ahead and placed the order and was told 20-30 mins. Well and hour and 15 mins later they finally showed up. I tipped the delivery boy and after he left we realized our order was completely wrong. One half had mushrooms, onion and olives and the other was plain. WHAT? My salad was nothing but iceberg lettace and one chunk of tomato. Plus they charged me $21.85 which included a delivery charge! . Well I called back to inquire why I was paying so much. I asked how much a 1.5 topping pizza and half salad was. I was told $15.65. I then asked why, since that's what I basically got , was I charged $21.85. The girl on the phone proceeded  to tell me that I actually got 4 toppings. When I explained that there were 3 toppings only on 1\/2 of a pizza and there was no pepperoni she said that it didn't matter I still get charged for a whole pizza topping and since the computer said I ordered pepperoni I was obliged to pay for it even though I told her I never got it.

I gave it a fourth star because the rice, beans, salsas and tres leches cake were some of the best I've ever had and I've been all over southern America and lived on the boarder for 20 years. But the skirt steak which is my favorite cut of meat to cook with as a chef was so disgusting I fed it to my dog!! Literally Azule ate the meat. The beef enchiladas with the Texas gravy which is traditionally dark and rich but in this case it was flat out burnt. Charred beyond recognition. The skirt tasted like it had been cooked frozen thawed out then served again. As a PRofessional chef im so sad because this cut of meat is very forgiving but today? It was dog food. The charro beans? Delicious and seasoned well. The rice was fluffy and cooked perfectly. I smothered it with salsa and it was award winning. The tres leches cake was creamy, cold, sweet and a touch of heaven. The chips were hot and fresh surprisingly having it delivered from doordash. The queso sauce? Forget about it. It was not memorable. Canned or trio bag sauce. Do not order this. Get the chips and guacamole. I called and asked that they make sure and send salsa with order and the guy was rude saying \"we have to charge for that, I can't add on to your order\". Dude, I got money! I don't need free salsa I just need a normal amount to be sent with my order. I expressed that the previous time I got none.

And you get a good value for your money. Personally I didn't enjoy a lot of the sides, when I did the build your own plate, but when I came back for a burger, that burger was out of this world. Chef Ra dresses them up so well and there are so many different flavors coming at you, which is what I love in a burger. I came another time for the Ra Pasta and that was a solid dish as well. Very unique. cauli wings were alright, but my absolute favorite thing I have had here was the nachos. This man dressed up the nachos so well, you get a huge portion for your money, and the cheese sauce in it tastes so reminiscent of cheese sauce and nachos I had as a child, so nostalgic and amazing, but is all vegan which is the best part! Location is pretty nice. It's a cute indoor setting and it's pretty easy to find parking in the area. One thing I will complain about is I would like to know what the vegan meats are made from. For example I got the vegan chikn on my build your own plate, expecting it to be homemade vegan chikn or seitan but instead it was fried mushroom, which it was still good, but I was hoping it would have some protein. If I knew it was just fried mushroom I would have gotten a different vegan meat. Anyway food is great and I hope to come back for the nachos or a burger!

What is the purpose of having a restaurant with crab cakes in the name of you aren't going to put the crab cakes in the plates ordered?  When calling to request the crab cakes 1) they continued to answer and hang up the phone. 2) when they finally answered they proceeded to say that crab cakes did not come on the plate and then says oh yes it does. The website says entrees come with crab cakes and they confirmed when we placed the order. The woman on the phone then wants someone to come back with all the plates. I would love to know what they needed the plates for. To try to locate the missing crab cake? Or maybe they would find remnants of crab cakes and prove we are lying that they did not put them on the plates. Or maybe they needed to remake the entire plates instead of just adding the crab cakes because by the time someone went back and forth the food would be cold. Either way....We Will never go again. The food is too expensive to leave things off of the plate and the staff apparently aren't clear what belongs on their plates.

We ordered the fried chicken sandwich, the spicy fried chicken sandwich, brussel sprouts, mac'n cheese, fries, carrot cake, and cheesecake. I tried everything except the regular fried chicken sandwich.\n-spicy chicken sandwich was really good the first couple of bites. Perhaps because I was hungry? It has that beautiful crunch that I love so much. But that really stops there. Because the patty itself on the inside is a bit chewy\/bouncy and maybe that's the texture of the seitan and I'm not familiar with it? I also noticed that it lack the spicy in a spicy chicken sandwich.\n-brussel sprouts were really good. Everyone loved it. It was fried well, light, crunchy, and not oily when you bite in to it. We loved it so much we got another order.\n-mac'n cheese was good, but just be mindful that you won't get that usual mac'n cheese flavor and it's more nutty.\n-fries were just plain old fries\n-carrot cake was moist and dense which is always good in my book. My little sister loved it so that's a plus.\n-cheesecake tastes just like a real cheesecake to me and it was so good.\n\nThey won't always have the cakes since the cakes are made by local vegans and dropped off so it changes all the time.\n\nOverall I would say give this vegan chicken sandwich a try if you're ok with the chewy texture of the seitan, but that batter is really life though.

So my food choices were pretty much from those recommendations. I ordered two spicy beef noodle soups, pan fried beef dumplings, bao, salt and pepper shrimp, and salt and pepper chicken. Starting with the dumplings, they were ok. Some were a little soggy even though some looked burnt. I liked that the shrimps were still fully shelled and head on. The chicken were extremely dry, hard to take down. I originally wanted the salt and pepper wings but they said it was discontinued. The salt and pepper dishes were tossed with onions and green bell peppers, which were a nice touch but they were extremely oily. The bao..the bao were the most disappointing. They were generously filled but it tasted like straight soy sauce. I couldn't even get pass the first bite. Finally, the noodle soup. They were also ok, nothing too memorable.

They opened right after hurricane Ida and I was just so preoccupied with other dire needs I was just frequenting the same places on my days off. \n\nSo today I went about Yelp trying to find new eats. As always I always prioritize finding new Asian cuisine foods and saw that this place was opened relatively recent and decided to check them out.\n\nWe came at 2:00pm on a Monday and there was no one here but us. We ordered the jian bing, the spicy beef noodle soup, the pan fried shrimp pork and egg dumplings, the bao, and the sichuan chicken.\n\nSpicy beef noodle soup: wow! The broth is really good! It was such a great mouthful of soy-base soup broth and a hearty serving of wheat noodles with braised beef\nAnd bok Choy. The chilies were a nice pop-in-the mouth with each bite and really was flavorful. Everything was lacking in terms of spiciness but I'm Thai and I love everything of mine to be fire. I added more chilies that they have on the table. \n\nSichuan chicken: they stir fried this with sichuan peppers, jalape\u00c3\u00b1os, and ginger. The dish lacked a little salt so we sprinkled some on and voila! Perfect. Chicken was nice and crispy and very tender inside, the fresh jalape\u00c3\u00b1os was a nice bite from the subtle sweetness of fresh peppers, and the ginger had a really nice aroma that resonated throughout the entire dish.\n\nJian Bing: the Jian bing was so unique. I've never had jian bing like this before, but it's also a regional difference as China is such a large country. It was filled with some type of fermented bean curd type sauce and a crispy wonton skin wrapper inside. Definitely worth a try!\n\nBao: the texture of the steamed buns were exceptional. It had a nice bite and chewiness to the bread but it was also moist and soft from the inside. The fillings shrank and left small pocket holes but they were filled with the juices of the filling. Win win win! \n\nShrimp, egg, and pork dumplings: amazing! This dish was one of the winners. Crispy on the outside and amazingly succulent in the inside. The flavors were phenomenal. I made my own soy-sauce vinegar on my own plate and dipped these in there.\n\nThe service was very prompt and we were in want of nothing. The owner came out and greeted us and we felt really welcomed.

I came away with mixed feelings.  I'm not trying to hurt this business.  Rather, I hope they consider my honest feedback and make some changes.  \n\nThe positives:  Burger tasted great and outdoor seating was nice.  It looked like there was even an outdoor TV (which wasn't on).  The ambiance was good.\n\nWhat didn't I like?  Burger was very small for the price.  A fountain drink cost a ridiculous $3 plus tax and tip.  Drink was served in a small glass which empties too fast, and glass melts ice fast when it is outdoors in warm air.  LARGER plastic or foam cups would be much better.  In any event, I refuse to order a soft drink in a casual restaurant for $3 plus tax and tip, so next time I will drink water.  If they were content to make a reasonable profit on a soft drink I would order it.  They make no profit from water, so it's their loss.  Instead of serving soft drinks to almost everyone at a reasonable price, they will charge an outrageous price and sell fewer.  That's a lose - lose for everyone because I enjoy a soft drink with my meal.  I am more likely to eat somewhere if I can order a drink. \nAnd by the way, they conveniently elect not to list soft drinks on the menu, so you don't know the price of nearly $4 until you get the bill -- a sneaky thing to do.  \n\nThere was an understandable upcharge for sweet potato fries, but they were not very good.  I get these at a lot of restaurants, and I'd rank these near the bottom for taste and quality.  Waffle fries are a novelty, but I prioritize taste over novelty.  Just give me a good quality, tasty regular cut fry and I'll be happy.\n\nNow for the part that really irritated me.  If I don't go back it will be for this reason:  I ordered a $15 hamburger that was supposed to have BBQ sauce on it.  It didn't have much sauce at all, so I asked for a little more.  The waiter brought out a tiny plastic cup with about a tablespoon of BBQ sauce in it and CHARGED ME AN EXTRA $.50 for a \"side\" of sauce.  Okay, sorry -- THIS IS A DEAL-BREAKER FOR ME.  If a $15 hamburger doesn't have enough BBQ sauce on it I don't expect to be charged extra to make it right.  Plus, it was a SMALL hamburger. \n\nThe more I think about it, the more irritated I get about the sauce.  So now that I've reminded myself of this, I probably won't go back.  It's not only the cost.  It's the principle.  And if management thinks people are too stupid to notice things like this on a bill, they are mistaken.  It's an outrageous policy, considering their already high prices.  Two small hamburgers, fries, and one soft drink was more than $35.  I don't think so... Sadly disappointed in all of that.  In addition, they don't offer a burger under $9, and every burger on the menu has cheese on it.  Newsflash: Not everyone wants cheese on their burger, and almost no one wants to pay for cheese they're not going to eat.  Again -- just a little sneaky.\n\nI do have to say though... burger tasted good.  But there are good burgers in other more reasonably priced restaurants who don't price gouge and nickel and dime customers to death.  I'm afraid if they keep these policies up, they will be closed reasonably soon.","name":"Three B's Burger & Wine Bar","address":"3322 N Turnbull Dr","city":"Metairie","state":"LA","postal_code":"70002","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":37,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","HappyHour":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","HasTV":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","Caters":"False","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': False, u'lot': True, u'validated': False}","RestaurantsReservations":"True"},"categories":"Wine Bars, Restaurants, Burgers, Bars, American (New), Nightlife, American (Traditional)"},{"review_id":"ESU0fhWHN0wtmrQ6iPLIIw","business_id":"q1whmG4Jdift2yL5nSJR_Q","stars_x":5.0,"date":1635302010000,"text":"The BEST food in town!!

There just simply isn't enough great selection. I was pretty impressed by the overall complex flavors of my broth and extremely impressed by the pork chashu inside the ramen and our pork bao.\n\nWe were seated immediately and was offered free sake. I passed on the free sake but changed my mind. The free sake is not something to write home about, it's flavors are not the best but it's free so no complaints. If you like sake you might look for a mouthfeel that is subtly sweet and nutty from the grains, but the sake itself is mostly a quick hit of alcohol with subtle rice aromatics. But once again it was free and the sentiments were nice.\n\nWe started off with three appetizers:\n\nCrawfish gyozas: these were okay, we weren't enthusiastic about it. It's served with sweet chili sauce, very likely Maeploy brand. \n\nAgedashi Tofu: these were less than okay. For a couple blocks of tofu the rice-flour coated tofu were very plain on its own (understandably) but the dashi-soy sauce was also very plain. Overall plain and bland was the takeaway of this dish.\n\nPork Chashu Bun: it's in a crescent style bun and the pork chashu was perfect! Delicious! Just salty enough and just sweet enough it literally melted in our mouths. The cook on the pork belly was extremely well executed. I was impressed! I ordered two more orders to go for my family!\n\nBang Bang Ramen: my partner got this ramen and I tasted the broth. Can't really remember the flavors well but I enjoyed it and that was what matters.\n\nHangout Ichimi Ramen: I got it at explode. As a spicy food connoisseur I looooove spicy food. The explode was not an intense spice but it was really well done. I'm not sure if they make their own chili-garlic spices but it reminded me of schezuan spice like LaoGanMa. The pork inside the ramen was the same pork from the bao so naturally it was really tender and yummy. The soft boiled eggs were seasoned well, the noodles were good, and the broth was delicious.

All I need is a pile of crab meat, with a little seasoning and a nice crunch. So I was excited to try @peeweescrabcakesonthego. I have heard mixed reviews about this place, so I had to try it out on my own. \n\n I went on a Friday during lunch, at the Gentilly location, and the business was busy. Almost all of the tables were filled and there were two people ahead of me before I could order. The service was pretty good. They definitely wanted to get you in and out.\n\n I ordered the special of the day, which was a seafood potato for $12 and a single crab cake on the side. The presentation  was OK. Maybe it would have been better if I would have dined in. The actual potato  was a good size and the sauce complemented everything. The consistency was creamy and it had fresh peppers  , overall it was pretty flavorful. The seafood in the potato included shrimp , crawfish , a fried piece of fish  and finished with a crab cake. Also there was some shredded cheese  under the fish. In addition I ordered a single crab cake on the side, by itself. \n\n The potato was simply sliced in half and was not mashed down so the sauce is not smothered in the potato. As I started to make the potato, I would scoop the sauce in the middle from the bottom. All the seafood was cooked well, except the crab cakes. To confirm my tasting I took a few bites from the single cake and I was disappointed. It reminded me more of a stuffing instead of a crab cake. It was very mushy, and the sauce on the single was a little sweet and not at all crabby. I was pretty shocked considering this was a star item on the menu! \n\n While I didn't care for this dish, I plan to go back and try some of their wings  and\/or pasta.","name":"Peewee's Crab Cakes","address":"4500 Old Gentilly Rd","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70126","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":42,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsTableService":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"},"categories":"Restaurants, Seafood"},{"review_id":"xVOUIQmVJiBtp63qG78jsg","business_id":"gUKCKxX5eD6YMlQEbTD1lg","stars_x":2.0,"date":1600646900000,"text":"Omg.

My co workers at the hospital enjoyed it. but i wasn't able to enjoy it cause i was sold a \"wedding cake\" flavored king cake and received something different.  The oreo cream cheese king cake was good, but i would have liked the filling to be an oreo's and cream (buttercream).  I was expecting a buttercream oreo filling.  It was good, but i probably won't get these two flavors.  The bread is more of a brioche with a hint of citrus to it.  The bread is soft, which i do enjoy.

Zero GLOVES WORN BY COOKS, kitchen help came out to get a drink and never the 1st handwashing......WOW!!\n\nI don't know where to start. I live here in New Orleans, my brother and his daughters were in from Arizona. I was wanting to show them an iconic New Orleans Staples, such as Daisy Dukes. I remember when this place was American Pie Diner and it could not have been better. Upon Daisy Dukes taking over, service has declined, the quality of the product is not the same as they are at other locations, and the staff was inherently rude. Never mind the fact there were food particles all over the place and in this growing age of COVID-19, I felt very uncomfortable. Nevermind the fact there is no handwashing going on, people touching their faces that were behind the line and the service desk..... I did not see the first repository of hand sanitizer anywhere in the building nor did I noticed any red buckets for cleaning.\n\nSo, we walk in at 11:33 a.m., according to my Google timeline, and we then proceeded to sit there for about 5 minutes before a middle-aged woman, with a bad case of resting bitc* face, with pinkish hair, and a wrinkled face finally came over to us and dropped off menus. She then proceeded to handle other guests and sit at least two or three tables. Those tables got sat, they got served, and they got menus, they got drinks placed on their table, meanwhile, they entered the building 10 minutes after we did. At the 15 minute mark, she comes over to say \"hey I have your drinks on the bar and I'm going to get them to you shortly.\" Another table comes in and they get from sat,, drinks, and menus. Meanwhile, I'm staring at a menu in a table with four other people and my brother says to me \"is this the best New Orleans can do?\" We persisted to wait while other guests continue to get served and handled before we did despite coming in after us. We never once had an interaction with this woman so it's not as if we're being unreasonable. We were just sitting here for 15 minutes and not one drink was placed on the table. After another 10 min, I finally asked her, \"hey, other tables get served, sat, menus, and drinks. Why exactly is my table being made to suffer?\" She again said \"well your drinks are on the bar and I'm trying to do the best that I can\", to which I responded, \"well if this is the best you can do, it's definitely not good enough.\" \"25 minutes and not even a drink..... she then snapped around and nastily claimed it hadn't been 25 minutes Honey, you lost the point. Take care of your customers and quit having personal conversations and you might be able to get something done\n\nStay away!  this place is horrible since Daisy Dukes has taken over and I could not be more disappointed at a New Orleans pillar of hospitality and foodservice.\n\nYOU WON'T ONLY BE SORRY YOU WILL DIE OF THIRST..... a Bactrian camel could not survive we were so thirsty......\n\nCOVID-19 IS A REAL POTENTIAL HERE WITH THE DEPLORABLE CONDITIONS INSIDE......\n\nPARCHED NEW ORLEANIAN!!","name":"Daisy Dukes Diner","address":"2244 Veterans Blvd","city":"Kenner","state":"LA","postal_code":"70062","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":22,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"True","GoodForKids":"True"},"categories":"Cajun\/Creole, Southern, Breakfast & Brunch, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"O6EL5D-29f5RPIgdjIon9A","business_id":"RAmtKHxjvejgx9Cs0tND3A","stars_x":5.0,"date":1609413417000,"text":"This is the best restaurant in New Orleans.

I called Caluda's to see what was up and heard an outgoing message saying, basically, chill. Your cake will get there when it gets there and it will be fresh. \n\nWhich it did and it was. \n\nCaluda's King Cake is yeasty, moist and flavorful. The icing is the perfect sugary compliment to the dough. And of course it's sprinkled with sugars  (purple for justice, green for faith, and gold for power.) It arrived on my doorstep with a Mardi Gras cup and three strings of Mardi Gras beads. Talk about putting me in the Mardi Gras spirit.

There is a small section on the box, where you can see part of the king cake. Just looking at it was a treat... so aesthetically pleasing. Opening it and smelling it was the best, but tasting it was the absolute bestest. Before I get into the taste, let me just tell you how beautiful of a presentation the king cake was, with sliced apples layered over the top topped with edible glitter. It looked too beautiful to eat. I couldn't resist and had to cut into it and start chowing down. The cake itself was so moist and the layer of flan was incredible + the apples took the cake. I was in heaven. This was the best $32 I ever spent on a king cake and I would do it over and over again!

Still no acknowledgment but we've already had a 2 min. staring contest so I know she's seen me. \n\nFinally when she handed the bag to the other customer did she ask,\"What do you want?\" I told her I was here to pick up.

Long story short, this was the worst Chinese I've ever tasted in my life. The egg rolls where meatless although they should have been shrimp and pork. The shrimp fried rice was loose in a styrofoam container. Everyone in New Orleans is accustomed to having the rice packed in the container. In top of that, the shrimp were not fresh shrimp and looked like they were just thrown in the container. There isn't enough seasoning or fried egg and there is nothing about the rice that remotely seems like it's been in a wok. AND it's yellow! The shrimp toast was burnt and tasted so weird that I spit out the bite I took and told my family not to eat it. It also has a strange smell and has a grayish color. Lastly, I ordered beef with broccoli and shrimp with broccoli. Honestly, I don't know how a restaurant this bad is surviving in a city like New Orleans. Both dishes ere mostly broccoli with the exact same weird reddish brown sauce that I have never seen before on either dish.

First, the online menu does not match the printed menus, and they only have 2 beers on draft unlike what is advertised (according to the bartender). Second, the bartender could not make a Pimm's cup or Moscow mule, however, did make a pretty good margarita. I tried to order the 3 side vegan plate, and was told he would double check they could do what I wanted. When the server\/bartender returned to the table he acted like it was all good so I didn't change my order. Two of the things that I ordered came out 15-20 minutes before my friends plates, and they were full size appetizers, clearly not the portion you would receive with a pick 3 option. I was not given the opportunity to choose how my fried cauliflower was served, even though the menu states choices of breading and sauces. My third full size appetizer was served before my friends' food, which was getting close to 40 minutes since we had ordered. When my friends' food arrived, I was immediately on red alert because the vegan option was supposed to be jackfruit, and she was clearly given a beef patty with a cream sauce on it. THE CRIME: after she asked the server to double check if her order was correct, he walked inside and walked back out, and told her it was jackfruit. She sent it back, and 15 or so minutes later he brought out what was actually visibly jackfruit with no sauces on it. She was credited 10% off the sandwich, which was only $1.70 off her meal. Our bill was rang up on one ticket, and we were told it could be split evenly 3 ways, but not by what each person ordered. I was left with $28 worth of appetizers when I had ordered a $15 plate of \"pick 3.\" When I questioned this, my question was steam rolled as he started another conversation. I handed over my card to pay for the entire bill since it couldn't be split, and when it was returned, the server was hovering over my shoulder waiting for me to complete the tip. He said he was trying to close out, it was 6:40. He had definitely been funny and upbeat at the beginning of our experience, but I found this to be completely rude and was the nail in the coffin for me. Thankfully one of my friends saw what was happening and diverted his attention for a moment. There could have been a reason for one or two slip-ups: we were sitting outside, they just reopened a month ago, etc. But for 7+ reasons, we will never return.","name":"Soul\u00c3\u00a9 Cafe","address":"2549 Banks St","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70119","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":34,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"HasTV":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","BYOB":"False","Caters":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"True","WiFi":"u'free'","WheelchairAccessible":"True","BikeParking":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","HappyHour":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","DogsAllowed":"False","BusinessAcceptsBitcoin":"False","Corkage":"False","RestaurantsTableService":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"True"},"categories":"Vegan, Desserts, Restaurants, Soul Food, Vegetarian, Food"},{"review_id":"FWnrdFnvPeHFhctz3HEpsQ","business_id":"fyVp9XdUrcMxBUn4h1ZmmQ","stars_x":5.0,"date":1632543220000,"text":"This place is AWESOME!

Missing items, completely wrong order, \none completely incompetent staff member who just can't get out of her own way, and it takes at least an hour- for anything.\n\nThe food is good - the aggravation isn't worth it.  I know places need to work out the kinks - and good help is hard to find - but right now - they're on our \"no go\" list until they work it out.  It's just too much drama and they try to make up for the mistakes - always - but it takes an hour + and we are not going at peak times.\n\nWe\n\n\nStopped by the new, permanent location at 5321 Franklin Ave. for some absolutely fantastic bbq.  We had a brisket plate with potato salad and slaw, a lb. of prime brisket burnt ends that were da bomb, an order of brisket boudin rolls and an order of the soul rolls.  All of it was spot on.  The white sauce for the boudin rolls and the bbq sauce (obviously served on the side) were excellent compliments to the rolls.  \n\nThe brisket had a beautiful smoke ring, the meat was cooked tender but not mush, and the flavor profile allowed the natiral flavor of the meat to shine through.\n\nThe burnt ends were some of the best I've had in New Orleans.  A few fatty pieces a few lean pieces and some combo pieces.  Again, the meat was the \nstar - not the rub or salt, which is what I find happens a lot.  \n\nRight now Shaggy is building out the permanent space and has his food truck in the parking area right next to the space.  Hours are basically Wednesday - Saturday from 11am until the bbq is gone.\n\nYou can call ahead to place an order - but the wait time if you just roll on over there is very reasonable.  It's a great addition to the neighborhood.\n\nHopes are that the permanent space will be open late fall....nothing but goodness.","name":"Nola Crawfish King Seafood & Barbecue","address":"5321 Franklin Ave","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70122","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":40,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Caters":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","GoodForKids":"True","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True"},"categories":"Barbeque, Restaurants, Specialty Food, Caterers, Seafood Markets, Food Trucks, Sandwiches, Chicken Wings, Cajun\/Creole, Seafood, Yelp Events, Food, Local Flavor, Event Planning & Services, Smokehouse"},{"review_id":"Q37JeeiqQEzwJkN4wnS__A","business_id":"EONd-1BeBm04FBLvWe6KMQ","stars_x":5.0,"date":1625084053000,"text":"Great smash burgers that doesn't make you feel too gross for eating a burger!

We had a brisket plate with potato salad and slaw, a lb. of prime brisket burnt ends that were da bomb, an order of brisket boudin rolls and an order of the soul rolls.  All of it was spot on.  The white sauce for the boudin rolls and the bbq sauce (obviously served on the side) were excellent compliments to the rolls.  \n\nThe brisket had a beautiful smoke ring, the meat was cooked tender but not mush, and the flavor profile allowed the natiral flavor of the meat to shine through.\n\nThe burnt ends were some of the best I've had in New Orleans.  A few fatty pieces a few lean pieces and some combo pieces.  Again, the meat was the \nstar - not the rub or salt, which is what I find happens a lot.  \n\nRight now Shaggy is building out the permanent space and has his food truck in the parking area right next to the space.

The restaurant is super cute and the staff are very nice. You place your order and then wait for your order. They have both Inside and outdoor seating. After you order the cashier takes your name and number so they can text you when your order is ready. I thought that was pretty cool. They also have a rewards program to earn points for free food!! They take cash and card. Bathroom was clean. They have TVs and cool wall decor.

By far the worst dining experience I have ever had in my city. I was excited to take my mom here since she is vegan because they have advertised themselves as such. There were honestly a lot fewer options than I had anticipated. That wouldn't have been too bad if the entire dining experience wasn't so terrible. To start things off, the waitress was less than enthused that we were there in the first place (party of 4). The restaurant was dead so you would think they would be happy to have business on a Monday evening. She sighed and told us to seat ourselves. Once she returned she seemed a bit scatter-brained and did not know answers to basic questions about the menu. We ordered fried green tomatoes to start and then a jerk chicken sandwich, a Soul\u00c3\u00a9 Burger, fried eggplant salad, collard greens, and chicken wings. It took 30 minutes for 4 small slices of fried green tomatoes. They were good but nothing special. Another 30 minutes goes by (it's been an hour at this point), and the waitress finally comes back (we are still the ONLY table seated). She says that my jerk chicken sandwich is ready, but they are having trouble in the kitchen and don't know how much longer the rest will take. She says I can eat my sandwich now and that she will bring the rest when it's ready. Jerk chicken implies spice (this was the most plain chicken breast I have ever seen with 0 flavor added- it was literally white piece of meat with no spice) Fifteen minutes pass, and I ask her if she knows if the problems in the kitchen will be a quick fix or if she recommends we just find food elsewhere if they're having problems. She doesn't care to elaborate and just shrugs her shoulders and says she doesn't know what to tell us. Literally 0 explanation. I ask her to bring the check. I honestly thought the manager\/owner\/chef would have apologized for not being able to cook our meal (still don't understand what was happening in the kitchen because it's an open air kitchen and we were sitting right next to it and could see them the whole time). This place did not seem to care whatsoever that the service was reprehensible and there was no accountability for what happened. They almost seemed glad that they weren't going to have to make the rest of the food. This whole experience was honestly bizarre from the get go. We immediately did not feel welcomed. We sat for dinner early evening so this wasn't even close to near closing time and we were respectful about dining in- we wore masks the entire team while seated when not eating\/drinking. We even paid the entire bill for what had been brought out, and no- there wasn't any type of discount or \"this is on the house for the terrible waste of your time\".  There is honestly no explanation or excuse they could have ever given to forgive what happened here, but I have the feeling that they don't really care either way.","name":"Soul\u00c3\u00a9 Cafe","address":"2549 Banks St","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70119","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":34,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"HasTV":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","BYOB":"False","Caters":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"True","WiFi":"u'free'","WheelchairAccessible":"True","BikeParking":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","HappyHour":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","DogsAllowed":"False","BusinessAcceptsBitcoin":"False","Corkage":"False","RestaurantsTableService":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"True"},"categories":"Vegan, Desserts, Restaurants, Soul Food, Vegetarian, Food"},{"review_id":"0vUAQMJBH6qCyoL67JBjfA","business_id":"VilDB2AuwZ5vudf99mH37A","stars_x":5.0,"date":1583699003000,"text":"The best experience in NOLA!

He looked a little doubtful at first, but he probably gets a lot of a-holes who pee and run during Mardi Gras lol. \nOMG if I thought the front of the bar was cute...well, the washroom was adorable. There was a flower-filled meadow on the wall and stickers everywhere. Loved one said \"You are beautiful.\"  So cute. There's a picture below.\nThe front of the house was also just magical. There is this really cool artwork on the wall, some with a voodoo vibe. Very colourful, always something new to see and take in as you look around. The best part is the tree over the bar. On the menu, it said that the magnolia blossoms overhead numbered over 500 and were hand-painted. There was also some other interesting info on there, but at the moment, I can't remember, lol. Another very cool thing was the jars hanging from the tree filled with lights. Some twinkled, like real fireflies. It was just beautiful. \nThe bartender did warm up once I kept my promise. I told him I love coconut and tequila, so he made me his own concoction with a hefty dose of tequila and some coconut cream. Awesome drink! By the time the hour passed, I was buzzing like a bumblebee. I also got another to take on the tour. They do not skimp on the alcohol.\nI met some really nice people who also came in before meeting for the tour. The atmosphere is friendly, and people were chatting, drinking and eating with smiles on their faces. \nA new bartender came in and she looked just like all the pictures of Marie Laveau, the voodoo queen. I told her, and that seemed to make her happy. I certainly meant it as a compliment. She was very friendly, and as the place filled up (I was the only person in there when I arrived) she kept up with the drink demand easily.\nThis is a great place for a good strong drink and pizza if you can eat wheat.

Once a food truck, now  a brick and mortar location (they still do food trucks\/pop ups), Bub's  Burgers was formed just last year and it's no surprise they've already  garnered a following because their burgers are amazing. I'm always on  the lookout for the best burger in New Orleans and Bub's NOLA did not  disappoint.\n\nThe exterior looks beautiful. The inside isn't too  big but also looks nice. The staff was great and very friendly. There's a  water machine if you prefer not to pay for a bottled water or bottled  drink. The prices are pretty moderate, what you'd expect from a burger  joint. 2.50 for bacon is a bit extreme but, the food was fresh, the  fries were great, and the burger overall was really, really good. Their  Bub's sauce I can best describe as a sweet mustard.\n\nI look forward to watching this establishment grow in popularity and  will cheer for it's success with my consistent business.

I ate every piece of it from the rooter to the tooter. I don't know what the secret sauce, I can taste a little bit a hot sauce in there but I'm not quite sure.  At any rate, it's all that and a bag of chips. \n\nIt's still early in the season, so the crawfish are priced a little higher than I would like for them to be, but I do expect once the season is in full swing that the crawfish prices will come down. \n\nI'm loving that they are less than 5 miles from my house, so I can get my CRAWFISH on whenever I want.

We got the Baller Boil Platter. It was hot with heat and dang hot with spices. My sister & I silently wondered if the spice was too much. We were both pleased that we could settle in and enjoy it. Loved it all. Corn was fresh (yes I know when they have that frozen crap). Sweet potatoes in a boil was a nice touch. White Potatoes were cooked just right and did not have too much spice. The crawfish and shrimp were spicy & very good and the crab was sweet but still spicy. Loved the Turkey neck too! No complaints on the boil once I settled in and got used to the spice level. The chili butter at the base of the platter was one of the best I have had so far.  The lemongrass and herbs in  boil was a nice touch. Remoulade dipping sauce was really good and felt homemade. Service slipped a little when it got busy but overall pretty good. Definitely going back to check out the rest of the menu. Four stars because I have not been through the menu enough to comfortably give a 5 star rating. But the expressions of persons eating the crab fingers was that of pure joy!

A newcomer to the game is Pauli's Gee's Crescent City Slice Shop. A colleague told me about this new place, which boasted both New York and Chicago style slices. Since I was short on time, I ducked in and quickly scanned their offerings. I was pleasantly surprised to see no fewer than 6 different pizzas on display, all available by the slice. Plus, there were both meat, vegetarian , and vegan options. The crusts varied from thin to thick. All of them looked good in the glass display! I spoke with Marie about the options and I settled on two slices: Freddy Pepperoni Square Slice (thick crust)  and a Sausage Slice (very thin crust). I enjoyed the crunch of the thick crust, as well as the rich flavor of the tomato sauce. Interestingly, the cheese on the thick crust was in the middle of the crust. Honestly, this new style of cheese placement was not my favorite because I didn't get the sense of the cheese - it seemed to be too melded with the dough maybe...? As for the thin slice, the sausage was a bit dried out, the sauce was almost non-existent, and the crust was undercooked. I'm guessing I just happened to get a slice that came out of the oven prematurely. My recommendation is slightly more sauce for sure so that there is a good flavor profile for the thin slices. The restaurant was clean and had ample seating. Once more marketing is done and people get to know this new pizza joint, they'll likely find success through customer feedback and great recommendations.","name":"Paulie Gee's Crescent City Slice Shop","address":"726 Julia St","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70130","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":48,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': True, u'street': None, u'lot': None, u'validated': None}","RestaurantsReservations":"False","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': None, u'casual': True, u'touristy': None, u'trendy': None, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': None, u'classy': None, u'upscale': None}","GoodForKids":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"False","OutdoorSeating":"False"},"categories":"Italian, Restaurants, Pizza"},{"review_id":"Fxq_v5vs-6_V2eNk7FbHjQ","business_id":"paf-TbchoCfQoHPVOoNvlQ","stars_x":5.0,"date":1635121551000,"text":"Beautiful decor, welcoming patio and the best damned seafood in town.

The menu is fairly simple. They have cheese pizza and pepperoni pizza, but they also have this garlic \"mootz\" pizza. I've never heard of it, but I ordered one slice of that and the Freddie pizza. It was a square pizza with just sauce on top and sesame seeds on the bottom. I think the cheese was baked into the crust or something. Both pizza were amazing!

Nice big windows make for an open and airy feel.  You can choose between brewing methods for your coffee.  The croissant sandwich was great--very fresh.  My partner ordered the Cuban sandwich, but  a few minutes later the server came out to say they didn't have the bread, so he ended up switching to the two-egg breakfast.  As we were eating, the chef, Noah, noticed our dog and brought over a homemade dog biscuit.  On our way out, Noah came over again and let us know that he takes tremendous pride in the Cuban sandwich on the menu, and that he was sorry the bread hadn't been available--the supply chain right now is just tough.  He handed us a bag, however--it was a fresh Cuban sandwich on the house.  He had personally gone out to get the bread and brought it back to whip up before we left.  What incredible and thoughtful service.  And the sandwich was legit--the flavors were just right, the ham was tender, and the crisp on the bread was perfect.","name":"Frenchmen All Day","address":"630 Frenchmen St","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70116","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":27,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"WheelchairAccessible":"False","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsTableService":"True","Caters":"False","OutdoorSeating":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","WiFi":"u'free'","GoodForKids":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","HasTV":"False","BikeParking":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': None, u'lot': None, u'validated': False}","BYOB":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True"},"categories":"Gastropubs, Cafes, Nightlife, Breakfast & Brunch, Coffee & Tea, Food, Restaurants, Bars"},{"review_id":"-L3r3s-CY_xAXKztU60ydA","business_id":"paf-TbchoCfQoHPVOoNvlQ","stars_x":5.0,"date":1638036188000,"text":"What a delightful, charming, casual outdoor lunch we just had.

The round pies are the perfect specimen of NYC pizza - thin enough to fold, crispy, flavorful tomato sauce, just enough cheese for balance. I also tried a square slice, which was not too thick and had a nice crunch on the bottom from the sesame seeds, which I took a picture of but you can't really see. I actually wanted the square slice without pepperoni, but was given one with it so I just ate it rather than try to exchange it.\n\nI did observe a couple of people receiving the wrong order and my coworker went later that day and also received the wrong order. Which is a bit strange, since there are only like 6 things on the menu. I think they're still working out the kinks organization-wise and will figure it out. \n\nThe pizza is incredible and my order came out fast. I went early and there was plenty of seating, but by noon it filled up quickly. I'm definitely going to swing by and pick up a whole pie to take home in the near future. Also, they are vigilant about cleaning, as they have a person constantly spraying and wiping down surfaces.

Their courtyard and porch is wonderful. \n\nWe got two cocktails. I got the cucumber one (can't remember the name) and it was very good! Really liked their drinks. \n\nThe appetizer options leave something to be desired. We ended up getting the onion rings which were fried great but were pretty spicy (and this is coming from someone who loves spice). The dip they came with was also extremely spicy and vinegary which I didn't like. \n\nSpeaking of sauces, all their sauces were disappointing and didn't really match the flavor profile of what you're eating. Most had a very vinegary taste. We also got the fried seafood plates and they served it with a vinegary green sauce which was just awful. Honestly wish they just had the basic tartar and cocktail sauce. \n\nThe fried seafood was hit or miss. I will say the shrimp were VERY good and VERY fresh. Reminded me a lot of how my mom cooked them. And they had that sweet taste that I've only ever eaten from fresh Louisiana shrimp. The catfish wasn't as great. Very muddy and kind of soggy. seems like there wasn't enough breading or it wasn't fried long enough. I didn't eat my filet. \n\nTheir options for sides were also disappointing. Your entrees don't come with sides. And It was weird to me that they had fried seafood without French fries. We ended up getting the cheddar biscuits which were pretty good, but just wished there were more options besides slaw, cucumbers and potato salad. \n\nIt's also a bit pricy for what you get in my opinion. but kinda expected that given these are the owners of Margies. \n\nI'm interested to try their boiled seafood next time and hoping that with time they'll improve!","name":"Seafood Sally's","address":"8400 Oak St","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70118","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":43,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"HappyHour":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': None, u'lot': None, u'validated': None}","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': None, u'casual': None, u'touristy': None, u'trendy': None, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': None, u'classy': None, u'upscale': False}"},"categories":"Restaurants, Seafood"},{"review_id":"Zi2_sKY8n1LRptDD5Ly8HQ","business_id":"PYJ7YSaMmHM_7C4WwOuFgA","stars_x":5.0,"date":1637630320000,"text":"\"Hot coffee and warm service\"--Frenchmen All Day lives up to this sign in their front window!

The menu is fairly expansive and the atmosphere is airy and relaxing. They have outside seating too for those lovely spring evenings where you can sip their fancy cocktails and slurp oysters. We had the Cesar salad and added buttered crab then tried the cornmeal fried oyster and shrimp platter. Since it was warm out, we had their chilled red wine then switched to rose. Their cocktail menu is creative so if you can't sit down for a meal, at least get a drink to go so you can check out this darling seafood restaurant.

After 10 minutes - nothing. All they had to do was cook the egg as the croissant was already made.  Our waitress asked the cook how much longer for our food and he said he hadn't gotten around to it. We were the only customers in there - what exactly was he waiting for?

I've been there a couple times for the classic slice of pepperoni - perfect crisp crust, and the pepperoni has a nice zing and cups up leaving that delicious, spicy meat nectar in the cup.  Tables forego Parm in place of garlic powder.  You can get a packet of spicy honey if that's your sort of thing.  I tried it, it's ok, dozens of better applications than pizza IMHO.  \n\nAnyway, so today was the first time trying the Freddie Pepp, which is their Freddie Prinze but with the addition of Pepperoni.\n\nRUN, don't walk and get yourself a slice of the Freddie Pepp.\n\nFirst, what is it?  It's kind of like one of those Detroit styles, with a focaccia-esque dough.  But what they do is put cheese down on the crust, so when it bakes, you get this crispy cheese underneath.  Then the nice pillowy dough, then the most amazing pizza sauce you'll ever have, then GOBS OF CHEESE, then that zippy Pepperoni.\n\nIf I'm gonna die, I hope it's with the taste of that slice on my tongue.","name":"Paulie Gee's Crescent City Slice Shop","address":"726 Julia St","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70130","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":48,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': True, u'street': None, u'lot': None, u'validated': None}","RestaurantsReservations":"False","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': None, u'casual': True, u'touristy': None, u'trendy': None, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': None, u'classy': None, u'upscale': None}","GoodForKids":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"False","OutdoorSeating":"False"},"categories":"Italian, Restaurants, Pizza"},{"review_id":"G6zSodYJiFul_VgJVTCYAA","business_id":"PYJ7YSaMmHM_7C4WwOuFgA","stars_x":5.0,"date":1633285563000,"text":"I was lucky enough to stumble across this great spot.

Each get a star to be fair. However my compliments and stars  stop there. \n\nTo start with, we ordered pick up via toast and among our orders was an order of boiled peanuts.  When the person coming to my home to dine with us arrived after picking it up, the peanuts were missing.  I called and spoke with the person I ultimately learned was the general manager of the establishment, I was told \"oh, we no longer carry those.\"   That was it. No apology. So after I was taken aback I could order something and pay for something they no longer carry, I began to inquire about options.  I could either drive back halfway across town for \"something else\" or drive halfway across town to get a $7 refund which couldn't be done over the phone.  The GM was essentially unapologetic for the circumstances and kind of aggressive.  That part of my experience assured this was probably my lone experience with the place.  Then we ate. \n\nOne dish was the oyster salad that was simply anemic and way overpriced.  You can get twice the quality at half the price at many local upscale places.  The real kicked was the $30 \"seafood bucket\" which consisted of two blue crab and 8 16-20 count shrimp along with two pieces of corn and three small potatoes all swimming in about an inch or so of butter at the bottom of a bucket that was about 1\/3 full.  The lid and the outside were all soaked with greasy fingerprints and the spice was \"inconsistent\" to say the least.  All in all it was a laughably overpriced meal.  If you look at my reviews I very rarely take to this medium to review bad meals because I think restaurants should get a few shots to get things right with me.  This place isn't getting their second shot after the poor experience.  There are plenty of places three folks can spend this kind of money for a much better meal.  Seafood in NOLA?

I was told that there wasn't Bloody Mary Mix, so I asked for a Vodka Tonic-No Tonic-But wait we did find the Bloody Mary mix so all is saved.  It appears that the back of the house staff is very competent.  They have figured out how to boil water, and use a fryer, make rice and have mastered the concept of small portions, and high prices.  Being a native of New Orleans-I'm really not used to paying $3.00 per shrimp-I.E. 6 shrimp in a shrimp cocktail for $18.00- no shredded lettuce, just 1 lemon wedge and a minuscule Ramekin of cocktail sauce, loving thrown together in a yard sale glass bowl.  Speaking of fine china-all of the small plates that they used seemed to come from the .25  table at a yard sale .  I also was impressed at the lack of Salt and Pepper shakers on the table-How Upscale and Chic.; though the food could of been better seasoned, and the crab listed in the ingredients, was not discernible in both the dishes that were ordered. So other than the food being lackluster and no where worth the prices charged, it was OK.\nHOWEVER- in tiny writing on the bottom of the menu, I was informed that a 3% service charge\/extra tax was to be levied to support the health and mental health wellness of the staff.  Frankly it is not the amount, but the concept that makes me not want to return .  First of all they are not my employees.  I would think that the employer, in a forward, looking and progressive manner would be happy to donate 3% of THEIR earnings to insure that their most valuable resource-their Employees are properly cared for.  I wonder if any of the funds-the 3% are kept separate and not comingled .  It would be terrible if by mistake that employee wellness fund be used to possibly pay the bank credit card fee.--Last but not least-I think in order to create a tax-that has to be done by either-Local, or state, or federal individual  ad is done via vote.

Finally! A decent pizza-by-the-slice spot in NOLA! (Or pizza in general spot, tbh lol.) I stopped in on the Friday of the first week and it was LIT in there. So, pizza wise: loved it!!! I had both the traditional large pepperoni slice and also the thick crust square-shaped Hellboy, and both were great! The Hellboy had this sweet\/spicy sauce; I'm more of a savory person when it comes to pizza so I'll probably move forward with the pep only, but the thick crust was crispy on the outside and soft n fluffy on the inside..if you're a pineapple pizza type person, go for it! Operations wise: they have a little bit of work to do. It was pretty packed in there but I still thought it took a bit long (maybe 30 min) for me to get two slices. The guys in there were working super hard, so I'm sure they'll figure out how to manage those high-influx crowds. They have a \"call out the name\" order pick-up system and it's not super efficient; it was loud in there and people could barely hear their names. Also, they only have bottled drinks and by the time I got there, they were out of bottled water. Again, this was about 5 days in, so I think they still deserved all 5 stars overall. Hoping they continue to be successful and tweak things operationally for efficiency (and, therefore, customer satisfaction) purposes. But it's great! So happy to have them in the city.

I went for dinner recently and it was a very mixed experience.\n\nThe service was attentive on the front end but on the back end it was a mess. None of the items arrived at the same time or in any predictable order. It seems like the oyster station got backed up and this caused a lot of confusion. We had people walk by our table 3 separate times asking if an order was ours. We didn't get the ordered shrimp cocktail until we were almost done with our meal.\n\nThe food was hit or miss. The crawfish tails (far from a mound) were fairly bland and the main note was oil - in fact at the end of the meal the bottom of the dish had congealed. The oysters were EXCELLENT - large and flavorful. Some of the best in town. I got the catch of the day as my entr\u00c3\u00a9e (amberjack, blackened) and it was sadly quite unflavorful. Points to them for it not tasting too fishy but also not great that it didn't taste like any kind of actual spice. The boiled shrimp were excellent although not for the faint of stomach. \n\nA note of caution on the cocktails - I got the Hemingway daquiri which is not a cocktail known to be spicy. Mine certainly was. I pointed this out to the waitress and got a fresh one and it too was spicy. I resigned myself to drinking it but I think what's going on is that they have a cocktail called \"the boil\" that uses boil spice and it lingers in the shakers and bar equipment. Which is to say unless you plan to order that cocktail I'd stick to the beer\/wine. \n\nHopefully with time the service kinks get worked out. This place has a lot of potential and it's nice to see a modern take on a classic New Orleans restaurant archetype - the seafood spot. The menu is currently a little uneven and it's hard to say how much of that is greenhorn staffing and how much is poor chef planning.

Fish sauce should not be applied to the subtle flavor that is blue crab.\n\nNext I was brought what they referred to as crawfish bisque. The soup was good, but crawfish bisque it was not, and I felt a bit mislead. Rather it had dairy, and no stuffed crawfish heads.\n\nI tried a crawfish crepe that someone else had ordered and it had a good flavor, but the crawfish tails had a black color and chewiness that indicates they had been frozen. Frozen crawfish tails are typically imported from Asia, and I find that to be an inexcusable crime.\n\nI had an appetizer of the Shrimp Absinthe. This is where things began to head downhill. The sauces had no taste whatsoever of fennel, wormwood, anise, or even licorice. The shrimp tasted nothing like any local shrimp I've ever had. Perhaps they were overcooked, because they were fibrous and even maybe crunch. Plus they were too large.\n\nMy entree was the pecan crusted puppy drum with a lemon-butter sauce. I will be to the point here - this fish was not fresh. It tasted as if it sat on the dock for a few days before it was refrigerated. It was not even edible. Furthermore the particular lemon butter sauce was a beurre-blanc, when any chef who's been to a few days of culinary school would learn that a beurre-noisette would be the sauce to serve on fish when nuts are present, as it has a complimentary flavor and aroma. The restaurant was more than courteous enough to not charge for this dish. \n\nMy wife dined on a very dry pork chop before being given a rather bland piece of bread pudding (please just add some Mexican vanilla and cook it until the outside has a crust) with a very thin white chocolate sauce. Another in our group ordered the cr\u00c3\u00a8me brule, which I got to taste, and was very good.

We went for the prix fixe Thanksgiving meal.  The price was incredibly resonable and the champagne was generous and free flowing.  The first course of butternut squash soup was delicious.  The rest was only ok.  I don't remember my salad.  My stuffing was filled with sausage so I didn't eat it.  My turkey was served with gravy on it although I asked and was given the impression that it would not be.  I believe the turkey was tasty and moist-- but the gravy was so distracting I cannot be sure.  I would have appreciated the opportunity to put the gravy on myself.  The dessert choices-- both cheesecake-- one pumpkin and the other sweet potato or was it pecan?  In any case all of us who ordered the pumpkin (including me) were underwhelmed.  Those that ordered the other option were satisified.   The best part-- the service and the atmosphere.  The hotel is beautiful.  The location in the French Quarter was perfect for a tourist family like us.

For the appetizer I ordered the Crab Cake with dijoun sauce and found it to be heavy on the cheese and not necessarily New Orleans style, very tasty though.  I ordered an additional bowl of turtle soup which was very meaty and quite good.  For the entree I ordered a Double Cut Pork Chop.  I found it to be cooked to my liking (medium) though tough.  The sauce was sweet and delicious.  The other entree, Swordfish Topped with Crabmeat and Cream Sauce, was much better.  My boyfriend said that the fish was prepared very well (not overly cooked) and the sauce was not overstated allowing the flavor of the fish to come through nicely.  The side dish of mashed purple potatoes were excellent and strangely enough tasted like cake.  The dessert of Chocolate Mousse Torte with Chantilly Cream tasted prepackaged and possibly frozen, though the cream was delicious and fresh.\n\nThe service was excellent.  Our server, Rebecca, accomidated us nicely with our wine selection by letting us split wines as my boyfriend and I have differing tastes when it comes to wines.  She was attentive without being overly obtrusive.  When asked a question about the cake-tasting potatoes, she got the chef to personally come to our table and field the questions.\n\nAtmosphere was comfortable.  The room was quiet, although there were few diners at the time on a weekday.\n\nOverall, I would return to this restaurant, however there are probably better places to go in this large culinary city.","name":"Roux on Orleans","address":"717 Orleans St","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70116","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":25,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","GoodForKids":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'quiet'","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","WiFi":"u'free'","RestaurantsAttire":"u'dressy'","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","OutdoorSeating":"False","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': None, u'casual': False, u'touristy': None, u'trendy': None, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': None, u'classy': None, u'upscale': False}","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': True}","RestaurantsDelivery":"True"},"categories":"American (New), Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch"},{"review_id":"kQrsBQfr7HtwoM8iHL6YkQ","business_id":"4HEz5_8g2QWfoOU27WndYQ","stars_x":5.0,"date":1573686304000,"text":"The maple bacon donut is so good!!

The restaurant is enormous, pretty, nice colorful! The music was a little too loud for my liking despite my request to lower it down but fortunately it faded as more people entered the restaurant. Our waitress was Ellen, whom was very attentive and was very customer service friendly. Food was very good, it wasnt too bad of a wait considering how many people were dining in that night but our drinks took a little longer than expected (probably because the barmaid with dark hair and glasses was on her cellular phone most of the time) Whoever the shorter male employee is that brought us our food looked almost mad the entire time I saw him walk into dining room and just tossed our hot plates of food on our table in a matter of seconds after mumbling something we didnt understand when he came to our table. I did return to El Paso a handful of other times, once alone, once with the mayor, and another with a party of 5 asking for either Ellen or Nellie but was given a guy whom I forgot his name but remembered it was that same guy who looked mad the first time my husband and I came to eat!!! So it turns out he is also part of management. So how do you distinguish when your a waiter and then part of management? (My husband was so curious he asked another waitress whom I think was named Monique, or Monica) if that was a reoccurring thing and she confirmed it was and stated her concern. Isn't that taking away your staff from making money? And is this manager on a salary and receiving tips? So he is serving tables everyday for lunch and dinner. Then, Great service, delicious food but lastly the one thing that I did not like was the way the manager on duty was speaking to our waitress with such disrespect. Come to find out its because she has been asking for more shifts and has been asking for weeks and he will not allow it but will allow everyone else to work, including one of the actual managers?? Is that even legal? Our advice to her, document everything!!! time, date, record who and what and the issue . I watched the way he was communicating with all his staff, and clearly saw how he was with her individually which I found very hurtful and actually very sad. If it continues, its definetly an issue for the higher up to address and handle possibly? Owner? Labor Board? Lawyer? Your local news outlet? The management clearly is inexperienced and doesn't care about treating ALL their employees FAIRLY and with respect .\nWe, the paying customers, the patrons, are filling your chairs and booths up come there to eat and enjoy ourselves, sometimes have a drink, enjoy a good meal, but in no way shape or form to feel embarrassed or feel heartbroken for another individual whom you can clearly see getting the short end of the stick for continuing to ask, to beg her boss over and over again to work. Or even pick up anyone's shift who can't make it to work. Neither me, our mayor or anyone can understand how a boss denies giving work to an employee that's desperately wanting to work and support her family doing an excellent job, and is a hard working mom as it is. Those are the employees you want on your team, not turn down and treat like garbage. We were very sad to leave tonight knowing her boss did that to her and or anyone else he's doing too. Anyone who's eaten here, I would make a generous bet, that they have seen how some people are being treated unfairly and lacks professionalism. Whether its dine in or to go. This food rating had snowballed into a whole other issue. Ending this restaurant review rant here, but seriously now I need to follow up with this issue as I now have only sparked growing concern and outcry for these men and women who are working for $2 and some change an hour plus tips that they have to share with the bar person and the person cleaning tables. And here's an extra tip for you ladies, at many of the local businesses that are all over downtown New Orleans and all through the city, Its mandatory for females to have those fake nails cut to a certain length. And thats the restaurants and bars that still allow females to wear those fake things at work.\nDo you know how much bacteria and nastiness gets stuck under people's nails? Especially working with food, and almost all the girls had long fake nails and waiting tables. Not all, but MOST.  I dont think anyone is coming to dine in for some tacos, a Michelob draft and a side of nails with some xtra queso. That's just gross. Yuck!!\n Respect everyone! Peace&Love&Harmony \nJudith S.

I love Pythian market so so much but our experience at La Cocinita was straight up terrible.\n\nWe ordered Pork tacos and build your own bowl. \n1. Price\/Portion: La cocinita is the only vendor at Pythian Market that I feel like it is truly over-priced. Three tiny tacos (absolutely smaller than tacos around the city) for $10? $11 for Build your own bowl, which is almost like taco salad or bowl in other establishment but a lot smaller, served in a red check paper tray that usually comes with when you order a hot dog on a street... \n\n2. Service: I give zero stars for this category without hesitation. We ordered at La Cocinita first, then browsed around other vendors, ended up ordering a Poke bowl, paid and received my order from Kais and came back to La cocinita and yet! not ready. Our order came out after a while but everything was wrong. As the name clearly states, it is \"Build your OWN bowl\" yet bunch of stuff we did not ask for was loaded. A lady next to us was waiting forever and apparently they sold out of something from the sampler she ordered and notified that to her when they brought out her order haha... (Why did you even sell it to her if you sold out!) \n\n3. Taste wise, it was alright according to the people who ate but nothing spectacular at all.\n\nI come to Pythian Market a lot like over 3 times a week and have not had any bad experience until last Friday. I think it was just that day that was problematic because it was apparent that the lady working behind the counter was not very aware of what was going on and messed up bunch of orders. The cook quickly realized the issues and fixed people's order but yeah, it was not a pleasant experience. I probably will give it a try one more time and might update the review but hey, two stars for now.","name":"La Cocinita","address":"234 Loyola Ave, Ste 8","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70112","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":27,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","WiFi":"u'free'","HasTV":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","HappyHour":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","GoodForKids":"True","Caters":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}","RestaurantsReservations":"False"},"categories":"Restaurants, Latin American, Event Planning & Services, Venezuelan, Caterers, Mexican"},{"review_id":"5GAr7utzGVN7PRZTwGBPmQ","business_id":"PuOAqoEqSsRD-kGmKrBemw","stars_x":5.0,"date":1557106042000,"text":"We went on Cinco de Mayo!

Well, this experience was extremely not. I ordered two orders of tacos and an order of the chips and guacamole ($$$). The two female workers seemed pretty busy cleaning literally everything so I thought maybe they were just opening... at 1:00 in the afternoon on a busy Saturday. So I placed my order and sat in an area close by so I could hear my order called. About 25 minutes pass and I haven't heard anything so I go up to the counter where one person is waiting in line to give put their order in. The two female workers are still cleaning every single surface and haven't acknowledged either of us. I finally get their attention and ask about my order and I'm met with a \"Oh, that order. No, it's not ready.\" So I say okay, and decide to wait at the counter. The two women then become extremely busy cleaning what looks like a drink machine. There are three food order tickets hanging up but they are still wiping out this drink machine and keep taking the containers off and putting them back on. I guess they decided then that it would be a good time to fix the food since someone was standing there. It took them literally 15 minutes to cook the food and assemble three orders. So about 40+ minutes later after I placed my order I got to finally eat some tacos. Tacos were good, but I won't be coming back to this location for them.

And, based on what I witnessed this weekend, Zhang is off to a very busy and successful start. I'm glad!\n\nThis review is based off my experience with take out. I haven't eaten at the restaurant, although the design and decor of the physical space are really appealing. They did a good job revamping the space, which used to be grungy. \n\nDuring a busy weekend dinner, the restaurant was very busy. There were a LOT of families and kids, which is not something I'm looking for in a dining experience. My takeout order was also 15 minutes late, which is not a huge deal--especially for a new business. They're still working out the kinks. \n\nOnto the food. None of the food was bad. My main gripe is that the items I ordered did not match their descriptions on the menu. I ordered vegetable fried rice. However, it didn't come with any vegetables. It did come with tofu, which I did not order. I will say that their tofu is outstanding--much, much better than the tofu I've had at other local Chinese or Thai restaurants. So I wasn't mad about that, but I really missed the vegetables. When ordering (and paying for) vegetables in a dish like fried rice, that means things like broccoli, baby corn, etc. This dish didn't have anything like that. Only tofu. So, while it was basically tasty, that's not something I would have ordered had the description been accurate. I also got medium heat (out of three heat options), and it was not spicy. So, if you're really into heat, I would go with \"hot.\" \n\nI also got the egg drop soup, which was delicious--easily the best item I ordered. However, the menu says it has peas, carrots, and mushroom. It didn't have any of these things. It's important that menu items are accurate and that the kitchen is in communication with front of house on this sort of thing. This might all fall under the \"working out the kinks\" umbrella. \n\nI also tried the \"spicy\" cucumber salad, though it was not spicy at all. It was more of a sweet, soy-based sauce. It was fine. The veggie egg rolls were standard, in the Thai style. For a to go order, the presentation was nice. The egg rolls had a slice of lemon and an attractive sprig of mint. I appreciated the presentation. I imagine the presentation in the restaurant must be very nice. \n\nI'll definitely be back in a few weeks to try other dishes and see how things have progressed. Overall, a very welcome addition to the French Quarter.","name":"Zhang Bistro","address":"1141 Decatur St","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70116","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': None, u'street': True, u'lot': None, u'validated': None}","OutdoorSeating":"False","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","RestaurantsTableService":"True","Ambience":"{u'divey': False, u'hipster': False, u'casual': False, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': False, u'intimate': False, u'romantic': False, u'classy': True, u'upscale': False}"},"categories":"Chinese, Thai, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"axPdCJvgLrgkiLycAV6NZg","business_id":"H3goPiqp7Dv-43Nu8zOdVw","stars_x":5.0,"date":1595805158000,"text":"We had the shrimp in jalape\u00c3\u00b1o sauce and bbq skewers.

I don't usually write reviews of this nature, but the owner of this place needs to be aware of the actions of their hostess, the \"face\" of the restaurant. I have to say that I was VERY disappointed with the reception we received from the hostess \"Mike\" this past Saturday nite, around 6:50pm. Having dined here before, we had never encountered \"Mike\" or her unique way of treating perspective diners. \nWe arrived and inquired if outdoor seating was available. We had no reservations. The indoor dining room was empty. The hostess informed us that the rear courtyard was full, but a table on the front sidewalk had just become available. We replied that was great, \" perfect we would take it\". Then the hostess quickly replied, \" wait, oh, we have a large party (12) coming in so that table really needs to stay empty, next time you should make a reservation\".\n\nHaving dined here 4 times since they reopened at this uptown location (Uptown restaurants thrive or die on their regular locals unlike quarter\/CBD establishments which often cater to the infrequently visiting tourists, it is a different dynamic) I was aware that the rear courtyard seats about 16 people, and there were only 2 other diners in the WHOLE restaurant, at best 25 percent capacity at 7 pm on a Saturday night! Besides, we were offered seating outside, at a sidewalk table that was occupied just 30 seconds earlier, hardly a staffing hardship! Hostess \"Mike\" went on to say, \" the kitchen is really small, you should have made a reservation, I am so sorry\" with a very affected manner. I had to wonder what would they do if they actually had ANY indoor diners. \n\nBackground; when this place relocated to uptown, I dined there on it's first night. It was EMPTY on that first weekday night. Our meal was very good, we paid and tipped waitress 30%. In addition, I was so glad to see a \"new\" restaurant attempting to open in our neighborhood I left $100 with the bartender to split with staff on this VERY slow night.  On that first slow night,  and on every slow night since,  the staff was very friendly and helpful. Not tonight with \"Mike\" the hostess at the helm. This owner's back story, printed on the menu,  promises her fulfillment of a life long dream centered on Italian hospitality and food prepared \" a Mano\". Our hostess's reception was anything but hospitable, and her refusal to seat us was simply ridiculous. I couldn't believe the owner had left this woman in charge of the \"front of house\". Accordingly, I asked to speak with the owner having dined\/taken out numerous times, and  then it really got inexplicably weird, Mike\"  the hostess refused to \"bother\" the owner! \n\"Mike\" informed us that she\/owner was \"really unavailable\", yet on the premises in the kitchen. \"Mike\" said she would not disturb the owner as she was \"working\". Really?  At this point you could not have paid me to eat, but in this difficult economic environment I could not believe what I was hearing. I hope the owner sees this. Really a shame, we used to love eating here.

My daughter ordered chicken quesadillas and was brought ground beef.  Had to send them back.  Finally after about thirty minutes the tacos show up made correctly.  We receive the bill and I see that I have been charged for the tacos and an up charge of 2.25 for onions.  I ask to speak with the manager.  The manager came over and I asked him to remove the tacos from the bill.  He proceeded to ask me why.  So I told him why.   This is the last time I will visit this restaurant.

My husband had the shrimp and grits and may I say that it's some of the best I personally I've ever tasted and he thought they were to die for. The sauce was the wonderful consistency but the flavor was outstanding. The shrimp were cooked to a perfection and season so good! I had the miso shrimp dish and it came on brioche bread with avocados scrambled eggs and a wonderful sauce on top of all of it. This dish was absolutely divine and to die for.

My food was not ready (it took them another 12 minutes) which was odd since there was just 1 table and 1 go order before mine. Anyway while I was waiting I had a long time to observe that none of the cooks were wearing face masks, and only one of the 2 waitresses was wearing a face mask properly. The improper one, who had the mask resting on her chin, was not going to tables but she was interacting with ice, utensils, and other objects behind the counter. \n\nI collect my food and get home to eat. Everything looked decent enough so I started with the catfish. It was actually amazing. The fish was perfect, sauce great. Awesome flavor. Unfortunately the shrimp they also threw in there were TERRIBLE. They were rubbery, like they had been boiled for 30 minutes. Some of them had shells on still. Undeterred I cracked in to the Red beans. It was meh. Had a strange aftertaste but otherwise it was standard fare. The Green beans were also average. The gumbo was probably the worst gumbo I've had in a while. Like the shrimp, the meat in the gumbo tasted like it was cooked too long. IT was chewy and rubbery. The gumbo itself didn't really have a gumbo taste. \n\nWaitresses were friendly enough and the fish itself was great but everything else was bad bad bad.

Back that up with some solid Tex-Mex food and you got a place I will enjoy.  El Paso is the best in this area that I have found.  (btw - you can debate whether this is Tex-Mex or Mexican all you want but in fact most of these dishes, enchiladas, burritos, etc. were invented in South Texas to feed hungry workers.  See Robb Walsh's book \"The Tex-Mex Cookbook\".)\n\nBack to that margarita, I ordered the house margarita which was 2 for 1 during happy hour.  Its good, not great, not too sweet with a decent tequila taste. For the price thugh quite a bargain.  Next time I will try their top shelf.  But what really hurts their drinks are the cheap plastic cups they serve them in.  A good margarita needs to be served in glass, preferable chilled.\n\nAs for the food, I had the Enchiladas Alcarbon - basically 3 cheese enchiladas topped with fajita meat, cheese sauce and a red or green sauce.  I got the green sauce as its hotter.  Delicious, the flavor and tenderness of the fajita meat was very good, the green sauce nice and spicy.  An excellent combination.\n\nWe went to El Paso on a Thursday about 5:30 PM, the service was quick and friendly.  I have heard from family that they can get backed up later in the evening.\n\nAlso our server told us they have music on Saturday nights starting at 7 PM.","name":"El Paso Mexican Grill","address":"2321 West Esplanade Ave","city":"Kenner","state":"LA","postal_code":"70065","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":49,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"HasTV":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","Ambience":"{'touristy': None, 'hipster': None, 'romantic': None, 'divey': None, 'intimate': None, 'trendy': None, 'upscale': False, 'classy': None, 'casual': True}","HappyHour":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True"},"categories":"Restaurants, Mexican"},{"review_id":"FH98kD57BCsPxv7IeNRohA","business_id":"ofXLzGLYFVb4AFFmNV837g","stars_x":2.0,"date":1626485387000,"text":"Bland food, pasta does not taste homemade contrary to their claims that all their pasta is homemade and very expensive for quality and quantities of food.

We sat at the bar and had some happy hour drinks (the Bali Lemon Freeze is delicious). The food is decent. BUT (and thus the rating) there is literally no spice to anything at all. We like extremely spicy  Thai and Szechuan food, and that's what we thought we were getting - not the case. We asked for ALL our dishes to be \"Thai hot\" (the hottest) and not a single dish was even mildly spicy, sadly. \n\nThe Spicy Cucumber salad is not spicy. More of a soy flavor. \n\nCrispy egg rolls were crispy egg rolls. Good, but nothing spectacular.\n\nThe peking duck sampler was actually pretty tasty. \n\nThe biggest disappointment was the dry red chili chicken. At a real Szechuan place, this would be numbing from the peppercorns and chilis, and pretty spicy. This one was neither numbing nor spicy, and was not really that great. \n\nMapo Tofu was good, and a decent amount of food, just not spicy in the least. \n\nThai Basil (beef) was tasty, but again just lacking all spice you'd want. \n\nIf you come in looking for pretty mild Chinese or Thai food, you'll probably be OK, but be sure to know what you're getting.","name":"Zhang Bistro","address":"1141 Decatur St","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70116","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': None, u'street': True, u'lot': None, u'validated': None}","OutdoorSeating":"False","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","RestaurantsTableService":"True","Ambience":"{u'divey': False, u'hipster': False, u'casual': False, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': False, u'intimate': False, u'romantic': False, u'classy': True, u'upscale': False}"},"categories":"Chinese, Thai, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"RHq32zJbqfHWb6O1yfcuiQ","business_id":"LwBLK_hNI72tZYzuhYp0eQ","stars_x":5.0,"date":1637799118000,"text":"I ordered from here tonight and was super impressed with the quality and taste!!!\nI highly recommend","name":"Zhang Bistro","address":"1141 Decatur St","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70116","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': None, u'street': True, u'lot': None, u'validated': None}","OutdoorSeating":"False","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","RestaurantsTableService":"True","Ambience":"{u'divey': False, u'hipster': False, u'casual': False, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': False, u'intimate': False, u'romantic': False, u'classy': True, u'upscale': False}"},"categories":"Chinese, Thai, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"n3yIi9FAOKwWlHmXrJRzgA","business_id":"LwBLK_hNI72tZYzuhYp0eQ","stars_x":5.0,"date":1639890969000,"text":"Ordered the Thai fried rice and vegetable fried rice with shrimp and green beans with dumplings and the coconut soup.

The only thing that was just eeehhh was the soup. It was a little bland in flavor idk if the try to use the same broth for the two soups so they don't put the meat in it and it's served on the side. The flavor comes from the meat. It was our first time eating queso golden and it was delicious .

There were originally 6 of us on our reservation, but one of us wasn't feeling well at the last minute so she stayed behind. We were seated at a table for 4 because we were less than 6 at this point. It was a bench against the wall on one side and 2 chairs on the other. The 3 of us on the bench side were really smushed so we asked if we could have a larger table. Um.....no.  Well, can we please add a chair to one end of the table?  Um.......no.   We were literally the only customers in the restaurant for the first 30 minutes. Eventually two small tables were seated. When we left, we were still only one of 3 tables.  I'm still scratching my head. The restaurant was full of empty larger tables the entire time we were there, and we were still left to be uncomfortable.  I'm not sure if it was personal because we were short one diner, but I certainly didn't want to compromise anyone's health by having a potentially sick person join us.  If space had been limited I'd get it. If we had originally reserved a table for 4 I would get it. I don't get it. \n\nSo now for the food.  Not bad, but most of what we wanted to order wasn't available. We ordered the meatball appetizer which was delicious, but we needed more \"red gravy\". Isn't this the name of the restaurant???? We asked for more and were told that the red gravy was made to order so it would take a good while. What??? Seriously???? We asked for some bread, and again, it is made to order and would be a while.  Eventually the check came, we gave the server our credit card, and lo and behold - here comes the red gravy and bread.  Too late. I give up.\n\nWe were smashed together, eating meatballs with very little \"red gravy\", and none of the menu items that we wanted were available. \n\nI just don't get it.

The ingredients are so fresh, and the liberal use of Thai basil is warmly welcomed. \n\nI like my food generally very spicy.  They offer three options and today I went medium just to set a baseline.   It was really balanced, just enough heat, but not enough to make you sweat.   All the spices were to enhance the ingredients, not overpower them.   We had several dishes and would happily order any of them again.   \n\nOf everything we ordered the chicken coconut soup was probably my favorite. Sweet, savory, crisp....

I've had the Chile rellenos, they are just okay. The nachos are good and I would order them again. I like their enchilada burrito. It is a decent size burrito filled with beef, topped with queso and the red sauce. The chimichanga is good too. Practically the same thing as the enchilada burrito except it is fried first and a little smaller. The tacos are good too. \n\nThe service can be hit or miss.

The quaint atmosphere transports you and the smell of delicious food is intoxicating.\n\nWe started with the Nanni -- miniature meatballs served with red gravy and fresh ricotta. These meatballs were anything but mini, and the red gravy and ricotta balanced the flavors of the meatballs well.\n\nFor an entree, we got Red Gravy's famous lasagna Bolognese, which is layers of ricotta, mozzarella and Bolognese layered delicately together and served fresh-baked from the oven. The lasagna is made fresh, so there's a 30-minute wait time when you order, but it's worth every bite. Our waitress described it as \"a true lasagna, the way it's supposed to be.\"\n\nWe also got an order of the Bolognese -- hearty beef and pork ragu served with rigatoni.

However, even as a decided non-kid, I am quite happy.\n\nYou can get pizza, a calzone, bread with cheese in it, breadsticks with cheese on them, or for variety, sandwiches, pasta, or a dessert pizza. So basically, it's all bread and cheese, which is fair enough given the sign on the door (they do carry a gluten-free crust, FYI). Assuming you're down for that, however, they do it well. The sauce is sweet, but not too sweet, and the toppings exude pleasing aromas and a fresh taste. They offer several vegetarian specialty pizzas (I enjoyed the spinach and artichoke). The filled breads come with two dips: spices in olive oil and tomato sauce. The banana dessert pizza that I ordered solely because it was part of a cheap online special was just delectable.\n\nIt's not an impressive place to eat in, but they are well optimized for the takeout experience and are timely (if not so fast as to make you think they didn't work on your pizza) and package things well. Having spent too long in places where solid neighborhood pizza was not available, I'll probably avail myself of this one again.","name":"The Pizza Shoppe","address":"5101 W Esplanade Ave, Ste 4","city":"Metairie","state":"LA","postal_code":"70006","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":46,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","GoodForKids":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","HasTV":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'quiet'","OutdoorSeating":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'classy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'touristy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","Alcohol":"u'beer_and_wine'","RestaurantsReservations":"False","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","BikeParking":"True","Caters":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","WiFi":"u'free'","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'"},"categories":"Food, Pasta Shops, Pizza, Restaurants, Specialty Food"},{"review_id":"gFC8Nwn1nBMLfteq4s5Odw","business_id":"p8sgZPvVq39bIklMO7x6ng","stars_x":4.0,"date":1459611858000,"text":"My first Beignets and they were fantastic.

I've been here for the past three days, and on two of those days, they had no beignets at all. Today, they had chocolate beignets only. A few years ago, they did have beignets, but apparently they can't figure out how to make them any more?\nCoffee: Someone needs to teach the baristas how to steam milk. When the sound of the steaming changes, you need to pay attention, not just wander off or wait for the machine to figure out that you're not good at your job and turn off the steam for you. When the steamer has been going so long that it no longer makes any noise, you've thoroughly burned the milk. Two out of three of my mochas have been of the \"chocolate and char\" variety.\n\nFinally, it's important to note that the service here is hit or miss. A couple of the employees seem enthusiastic about their jobs and work hard to help the customers. A couple other employees, today's cashier for example, are better at grumbling and rolling their eyes at customers. Some people just aren't cut out for customer service, and that's fine, but those folks should not be working the register.\n\nIn summary: If you're staying at the hotel and don't want to walk anywhere, this is a good choice.

We ordered and had it delivered to our hotel and the delivery was quick and the driver was courteous.\n\nWith that said, I don't usually give a poor rating unless the meal is truly bad in its entirety. Since there were both good and bad aspects of this meal I gave a rating of three. Though I have had better, the Supreme Pizza, Muffaletta Sandwich, Grilled Chicken Sandwich and Spinach Artichoke dip were pretty good and everyone seemed to enjoy them so I see no reason to give them a negative rating. However, the Chicken Alfredo that we ordered for my daughter was not good at all. I don't know if they left something out of the alfredo sauce or if something went bad but a couple of us tried it to make sure we had the same assessment and it just wasn't good. In fact, it was so bad that she couldn't eat it so we all gave her a little of ours to eat. \n\nAll in all, I wouldn't stay away because of this review.

The verdict? Excellent food, excellent service, excellent value. The only thing not excellent? My photos which don't do the dishes full justice. Can I give it 4 1\/2 stars?!\n\nI got there around 8pm. It was almost full. I was seated at a four-top, which was fine, tho I did offer to sit at the counter by the kitchen as I didn't want to take up extra space. My server Randy was very knowledgeable and guided me to choices that left me happily sated.\n\nStarted with the Verlasso Salmon (fermented Napa cabbage, cashews, cilantro, sweet peppers, sesame seeds, black garlic vinaigrette) SO delicious!! (Note: The presentation was MUCH nicer than my photo; I had already had a bite or two before taking the pic. It arrived in a kinda pyramid formation.) It's the type of dish you want to have another of as soon as you finish eating it. Sometimes in a dish like this you get lotsa the extras and only a little of the featured item. Not here; there was LOTS of salmon!\n\nDecided to splurge and also get the Roasted Bone Marrow with pistachio pesto, oven roasted cherry tomatoes and watermelon radish slices, as you don't often see this on menus. Not only was it very very good but (a) unlike some places where you just get the marrow and some bread or, in this case, baguette slices, here the pistachio pesto, oven roasted cherry tomatoes, watermelon radish slices and, a goodly amount of, I believe, dill, fleshed it out wonderfully & imaginatively and (b) for a change, there was a pleasingly plentiful amount of baguette slices so I didn't have to ask for more. Bone marrow may not be to everyone's taste...which just means more for me!!\n\nCrispy Pork Chop (grilled corn, mint, cucumber, avocado, buttermilk, watermelon molasses) Crispy it was; I actually thought it was too crispy, but hadn't realized that was what it was billed as--though I wouldn't've minded it being a little more tender\/moister, I guess you can't complain about something for being what it's supposed to be. That said, the watermelon molasses (the brown swirl around the pork chop) was so yummy it should be sold in sex shops for people to spread all over their partner's body after which it can be licked off. Lol Seriously, I asked my server for more of it and covered that part of the chop that wasn't already covered with the buttermilk. I don't think I licked its ramekin...but I sure wanted to! \n\nSalted Caramel Budino (orange and pistachio)  I wasn't familiar with the budino concept and, while I enjoy caramel, the pleasures of the \"Salted\" part always escape me; once I got to the pudding beneath the caramel topping, however, I didn't want it to end!\n\nI also had a very nice, and nicely priced, glass of the Syrah\/Cinsault\/Grenache rose. Light, refreshing, not too dry and with a nice bouquet, it was just what I was in the mood for.\n\nAbout the only glitch was when I asked the ma\u00c3\u00aetre d' if he could turn up the light a little bit as it was awfully dark at my table; it didn't seem like it would be a big deal as the lights had momentarily bumped up just before. He came back a few minutes later saying that \"the manager was busy\" so apparently he couldn't do anything about it. I understand that staffing there is a little crazy due to COVID challenges but this hadn't seemed like a biggie. He did offer to move me to another table but by then I had settled in so declined. Not a biggie but it would've been nice to better see my food.\n\nI understand that due to COVID craziness, most of The Bower's menu (the cheese and charcuterie boards) is currently from its adjacent bistro, Claret. When things return to normal, I was told that The Bower's options would expand offering more entrees along the lines of what I had.

Left more than half and threw it out eventually. Hard to swallow because with the tip it was over $60 even in these worthless fiat dollars we are now spending.

I am happy to say that I think I've found it! A couple nights ago, I had a serious hankering for some sesame chicken. I had tried a couple of spots in New Orleans and hadn't been impressed, so I hopped on Yelp to see if there was a new place I should try. I found Hunan Wok's page and the reviews were all so positive that I had to obviously place an order. All the hype from the other reviews were totally on point and Hunan Wok did NOT disappoint. \n\nI put an order in at around 5:30 on a Monday night and they told me that my order was ready for pick up by 5:45pm. I was blown away at how quickly they had it ready. I hopped in my car and was on my way. I realized once I got there that I had passed Hunan Wok multiple times and never thought anything of it. It's basically a bright pink shack and looks rather unassuming, but those are always the best places aren't they? There is some parking right in front and around the side but not a ton. Once you go inside, there are a couple of tables, but nobody that was in there was dining in. The tables and chairs are mostly there so that you can sit while waiting for your food. Service was fast and friendly. \n\nWe ordered a sesame chicken combo plate with pork fried rice (it's only an extra .75 cents if you want shrimp fried rice), two egg rolls (one pork and one shrimp), their triple steamed dumplings, and an order of their fried shrimp appetizer. The portions are HUGE and the total only came out to $25. What a steal. We didn't order any vegetarian friendly options, but I did notice that they had plenty. \n\nWe will definitely be ordering from Hunan Wok anytime we are in the mood for some tasty Chinese take-out!","name":"Hunan Wok","address":"2201 St Bernard Ave","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70119","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","WheelchairAccessible":"False","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","Alcohol":"u'none'","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","GoodForKids":"True","Caters":"False","WiFi":"u'no'","OutdoorSeating":"False","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': False, u'casual': None, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': None, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': False, u'classy': None, u'upscale': None}","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': True, u'lot': True, u'validated': None}","HasTV":"True"},"categories":"Restaurants, Chinese"},{"review_id":"O1QxOFeLZ_FHOJz09LO-Kg","business_id":"rJMMzZEUHVi4lrO-0c8OFA","stars_x":5.0,"date":1601349161000,"text":"Good food.

I loved the deep red from the beets in the 51 Problems and the sugar on the rim was a nice touch. I had the whipped ricotta to start and my friend had the octopus. The Whipped Feta was delicious and was enough to share for multiple people. It came with toasted bread and pickled vegetables. My friend's Octopus was a bit charred and could have used more flavor. For the main course, we had the Paneed Pork Loin and the Red Pepper Spaghetti. The Pork Loin was definitely the favorite entree. It was crispy with a flavorful, slightly spicy sauce. The pickled vegetables on top added a nice zing. The spaghetti was also good with a large serving of burrata on top. The star of the desserts was definitely the Salted Caramel Budino. It was very light and refreshing and similar to creme brulee. The Flourless Chocolate Torte was also very good, but was extremely rich. Overall, I really enjoyed my dinner at The Bower.

My family and I had just experienced a not so enjoyable dinner \"up the road\" in Belle Chasse and were feeling a little melancholy.  Instead of turning around and heading back to New Orleans, we decided to drive south on Hwy. 23 for a ways.  Like a beacon in a storm, we saw the sign for Dairy Dip and I knew that ice cream would have us all feeling better.\n\nThis place has been a Belle Chasse staple for 50-60 years, and it screams nostalgia.  And everyone who knows me knows I love nostalgic businesses.   Although it doesn't appear spectacular from the outside, I hear the food they serve is top notch.  This little roadside gem serves all kinds of classic foods like burgers, hot dogs, corn dogs, po-boys, nachos, malts, shakes, ice cream, sno-balls etc.  It's all walk up counter service here where you pay and \"eat outside, or in your car (if the times you are in are unprecedented).\"  (This last sentence borrowed from Yelper Marielle S.)\n\nAs we had already eaten, we got dessert.  I wish we hadn't eaten because I think we would have enjoyed Dairy Dip more than the restaurant we had just patronized, but I digress.   My son got a regular vanilla cone, I opted for the classic dipped cone and my wife got the dipped cone with peanuts. The ice cream here is delicious and served at the perfect consistency and temperature. Simply stated, it was delicious.  Next time, we're going to order burgers and onion rings and make it a meal.  Of course we are going to leave room for dessert.","name":"Dairy Dip","address":"9252 Hwy 23","city":"Belle Chasse","state":"LA","postal_code":"70037","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":34,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","GoodForKids":"True","NoiseLevel":"'quiet'","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': True, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","OutdoorSeating":"True","WiFi":"'no'","BikeParking":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': True, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsTableService":"False","DriveThru":"False","Alcohol":"u'none'","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"True"},"categories":"Restaurants, Burgers, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Food, American (Traditional), Sandwiches"},{"review_id":"w_HGAJGn7dYYIWl2NLwLFg","business_id":"rJMMzZEUHVi4lrO-0c8OFA","stars_x":5.0,"date":1580658690000,"text":"This is my favorite Chinese Place I always get the classic Boneless chicken which is delicious by the way I pair it with the combination rice, I would go here for the rice alone it's so packed with shrimp,chicken, etc with every spoon full plus they give you so much.

Tonight was the 3rd time we've ordered from them! Yes they are pretty good, better than your chain restaurants who deliver. Well speaking of deliver, they delivered with no problem each time.....until tonight. When the driver got here he told me \"we don't usually deliver here, just heads up, if it's slow like tonight then it's okay but not usually.\" I said \"y'all have delivered here twice and no one has told me that, I obviously wouldn't have called if I'd known that, I'm really sorry...\" He says \"it's okay I'm just letting you know we don't, it takes 12 minutes to get here\". Okayyyy, well this was our 3rd delivery and this is the first time they've told me that. We've ordered on a Friday and Saturday so I'm sure those were not \"slow\" nights. Anyhow, we live in Metairie in between Cleary & Transcontinental\". It does NOT take 12 minutes to get here from there. I've been living here my entire life, if it takes 12 minutes on a slow night it's bc you're driving way below speed limit. My mother in law lives on the parish line in Kenner, which is 8 miles from me and it takes 10 minutes at speed limit (I realize you have other orders as well but I'm going on what he said). Now if they don't deliver here that's fine, but to tell me at my door after the 3rd delivery was ridiculous. First of all they've never said that to me on the phone, 2nd the driver said \"they\" told him to tell me. I used to deliver food and as a delivery driver that is not his responsibility to tell me that. The person who took the order, manager or owner should've. I thought it was pretty rude especially when I just paid $35 for my order plus a cash tip that was right under 20% (the only cash I had on hand), I would've added $2 more to the receipt I signed but felt so stupid that I changed my mind, and I'm sitting here apologizing like I did something wrong. Maybe it wasn't the driver, I just know I never would've relayed that message as a driver and if the people on the phone or owner couldn't tell me themselves then that makes me question them as professionals. I was excited to have a new \"real\" pizza place that delivers but we won't be ordering from there ever again. I don't like to feel humiliated at my front door because of a mistake they made....3 times. Why didn't they tell me this the first OR second time we ordered? Or was the driver in a pissy mood? I've been there so I understand the whole concept but it wasn't like we ordered even close to closing time so....? Oh well, the pizza is good but I won't order from people who make me uncomfortable at my own front door. For any haters, this is a \"rating\" website. You rate YOUR experience. Like I said the food is good, for delivery pizza. But you either do or don't deliver to my area, and then tell me at my door that you don't after I just ordered $35 worth of pizza.

Describing this place in 3 words I would say \"delicious and trendy.\" Came here with a couple friends and we really enjoyed it. They ordered the bone marrow appetizer and devoured it while I sipped on a fun and flavorful \"mood ring\" cocktail that changes color when the vodka and lemon juice mixture at the bottom is stirred into the purple butterfly pea tea on top, turning the drink a beautiful blue color. For entrees I got the basil spaghetti because who doesn't love pasta and basil and it was one of the most highly recommended items on their menu. The burrata cheese on top really elevated the flavor profile of a dish that seems so simple at first glance. My friends got the potato gnocchi. They loved the flavors but the portion size was pretty small. They also had shared the warm Castelvetrano appetizer and while they loved the taste, they actually had to spit out the first bite because the \"warm\" olives were so piping hot that it burned their mouths. Dessert was phenomenal. Basil ice cream and some sort of pudding that forgive me is escaping me right now. Despite the olives and small portions, I still would have given them 5 stars had it not been for them sitting us outside. During these strange pandemic times I understand seating is limited and I'm impressed they managed to supplement with so much tented outdoor seating, but it should be something that should be acknowledged when reservations are being made. It's just a little disappointing to walk through such a beautiful, green, luscious dining space (see my picture) that you think you'll be sitting in and to exit into a clean but temporary tented outdoor dining room in Louisiana summer heat. Also this place is a little on the pricier side - the pasta dishes ranged $17-$20 for rather small portions. But all in all, if you want a great food experience DO NOT pass this place up!

Luckily they have a parking lot (thank goodness because I get tired of street parking everywhere). I ordered online so once I got there I got my food pretty quickly. Overall not a bad spot and I'd definitely give them another try in the future.","name":"Hunan Wok","address":"2201 St Bernard Ave","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70119","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":50,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","WheelchairAccessible":"False","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","Alcohol":"u'none'","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","GoodForKids":"True","Caters":"False","WiFi":"u'no'","OutdoorSeating":"False","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': False, u'casual': None, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': None, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': False, u'classy': None, u'upscale': None}","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': True, u'lot': True, u'validated': None}","HasTV":"True"},"categories":"Restaurants, Chinese"},{"review_id":"Q2sxP3eP_yp2mIHs_gBKDg","business_id":"5LfCqtP9rUEN9lzMZ1Q6WQ","stars_x":5.0,"date":1612729066000,"text":"Great fast-casual dining.

For years I've passed by this restaurant and never had a desire to drop in. However, the pandemic is really impacting the quality of our go-to Chinese spot (i.e., Chinese Tea Garden, of course), and we were looking for alternative sources. After researching Yelp, we decided to try Hunan, solely based on the reviews. \n\nOh, Yelp. These reviews remind me of a trip I took to NY a few years ago and almost every restaurant I went to, based on Yelp reviews, was a disappointment. So, are locals reviewing Hunan? I don't think I'm a food snob, but I do have standards. And this ain't it. We ordered the bourbon chicken, General's chicken, and shrimp fried rice. The best thing were the egg rolls. They were fried golden and had a decent flavor. They were a bit one note, though, with mostly all cabbage and 1 or 2 shrimp. Why do I think most of these restaurants buy this stuff frozen and all they do is heat it up? \n\nAnyway, the bourbon chicken didn't look like chicken. That was the first strike. Secondly, it didn't taste good. Strike two. The General's chicken was slightly better, but didn't taste like anything like General's chicken. The shrimp fried rice was just ok. Strike three and four.

Since they left Starbucks has never been the same. However the crew they had after them did a fine job up to a point and now the crew running the place leaves a lot to be desired. Starbucks is slowly becoming a place that I am avoiding and I find myself not minding the drive on West Esplanade from Starbucks to Puccinos. I honestly find Puccinos has a much better tasting product line than Starbucks - STARBUCKS IS QUICKLY BECOMING A HAS-BEEN!","name":"Starbucks","address":"817 W Esplanade Ave, Ste A","city":"Kenner","state":"LA","postal_code":"70065","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":30,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BikeParking":"False","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","OutdoorSeating":"True","Caters":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","WiFi":"u'free'","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","NoiseLevel":"u'average'"},"categories":"Coffee & Tea, Restaurants, Food"},{"review_id":"86r9YsdBvWm9UkRk4FsHYg","business_id":"a7RobRBScR0SVQVMKwkJmw","stars_x":1.0,"date":1533916644000,"text":"Who ever is responsible for ordering their supplies at this location needs to start ordering the ingredients for the Cascara Cold Brew.

As someone who previously made multiple trips a week there, I've dwindled to less than once a month because of this space issue and the fact that management\/ownership seems fine with the rest of their customers being inconvenienced just didn't work for me.","name":"The Royal Blend","address":"204 Metairie Rd","city":"Metairie","state":"LA","postal_code":"70005","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":43,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BikeParking":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","WiFi":"u'free'","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","GoodForKids":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"'casual'","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': True}","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': True, 'casual': False}","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","NoiseLevel":"'average'","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False"},"categories":"Food, Breakfast & Brunch, Restaurants, Coffee & Tea"},{"review_id":"KFO6ve6vqs-jzrM4672ztQ","business_id":"FRRN15VZZ9KKBFgVnVMrrQ","stars_x":4.0,"date":1566240734000,"text":"If you've ever been to a Firehouse Subs, this place is par for the course.  If you haven't, you're in for a treat.  Keep in mind that these aren't poboys.  They aren't less tasty, they're just different.\n\nThe bread isn't as good as Jimmy John's or Panera Bread, but it's a lot better than Subway and Quizno's.  They do a lot of sandwiches well, and you can always custom build your own, but as far as I'm concerned, the Firehouse Hero is where it's at--roast beef, smoked turkey, Virginia ham, and provolone melted on top.  I get it \"Fully Involved\" (fully dressed, plus mustard and onion), slather some Captain Sorensen's Datil Pepper Sauce on that baby, and drift off to seventh heaven.\n\nPickle comes on the side and it's tasty.  If you're going Large, and you like pickle, order an extra pickle.  The combo is of questionable value in my book, but if you're gonna get a drink anyway, just get the combo.  I like Doritos, but they have all the national brands of small-bag chips, and their baked goodies are as good as Subway (or better, depending on the item).\n\nI go here about once a month, and I've noticed that the tables can be a little dirty AFTER the lunch rush.  I think the employees are tired and a little off their game after the rush, so as the volume drops off, they aren't as good about the wipe-down and refresh.

Its a good thing they spend so much time on their appearance, because they definitely don't spend any time at all focusing on the customer, or even what the customer JUST ordered and paid for. Or that they took any order from any customer at all. On the few times I have been, I have never seen an employee of color or female. All white males.

The outside was a perfectly crisped egg roll wrapper that crunched with each bite. Inside had mounds of oozing, gooey cheese. They were like mozzarella sticks with even more flavor than normal. For our meal we shared the  Phorrito, which had Sliced Roast Beef, rice noodles, onions, scallions, thai basil, bean sprouts, cilantro, sriracha, hoisin wrapped in a hot flour tortilla with a side of pho broth gravy for dips, and the Vietnamese Crawfish Etouffee Nachos. The Vietnamese Crawfish Etouffee Nachos has so many words in the title and even more flavors to enjoy! Fried wonton chips, chedder & cojita cheese, scallions, cilantro made for the perfect pairing for each of the beers we tried.\n\nAs for the beer selection, it was very impressive. We tried a few as it was happy hour pricing (bonus!) While they had many selections you'd expect, we really liked their Vienna lager spiked with New Orleans Chicory coffee because it felt like something you could only get in the Big Easy. It was almost as bold as the Deb Does Chocolate - Chocolate Stout which featured mammoth amounts of flavor. \n\nWe loved our experience so much that each night during our visit we contemplated eating at Bywater Brew Pub a second (or even third) time!

Chef Elon Shaya and the entire Miss River team have created a flavorful New Orleans menu and thoughtful craft cocktails. \n\nWe started with the New Orleans Rum punch, which was equally balanced in flavor, sweetness, and strength. As a result, we each enjoyed two of these cocktails!\n\nOur meal included: Crab au gratin, Whole carved buttermilk fried chicken with sauces, red beans and rice, and baked sweet potato. \n\nThe crab au gratin was my least favorite item. It was good, but quite an expensive appetizer. While the crab meat itself was sweet, succulent, and fresh, the serving size (approximately 6 ounces) for $18 was a bit rich. Also, the au gratin topping was appropriately toasted but the entire dish lacked flavor\/seasoning and a binding component (i.e., creaminess).\n\nThe Whole carved buttermilk fried chicken is a show-stopper! The crust is crunchy and flavorful, the meat is tender, and the overall presentation is magnificent! The staff initially serves the chicken whole, for purposes of presentation. Immediately thereafter, it is whisked away to the carving station. By the time the pieces of chicken return, resting deliciously on a bed of rosemary, the accompanying sauces are there at the table waiting. There are three sauces, which are seasoned honey, crunchy red pepper, and a green herbs. Each of the sauces provided their own flavor, from sweet to spicy to pungent. Truly, the chicken was so perfectly seasoned that the sauces were not required, but they did add to the overall chicken experience.\n\nThe whole carved buttermilk fried chicken is an a la carte item, so we chose red beans and rice and baked sweet potato as accompaniments. The baked sweet potato was classic and delicious. The red beans and rice dish was well-seasoned and spicy. The red beans may be too spicy for non-Orleanians but a nice complement to the chicken. Plus, the rice was cooked perfectly!\n\nThe sweet end to the meal was lagniappe from the staff! While my specific recollection may be slightly amiss, the two different treats were chocolate chicory cookies and banana pralines. Both were flavorful and a perfect final\u00c3\u00a9.","name":"Miss River Restaurant","address":"2 Canal St","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70130","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":22,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Ambience":"{u'divey': False, u'hipster': False, u'casual': False, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': False, u'intimate': False, u'romantic': False, u'classy': True, u'upscale': False}"},"categories":"Desserts, Restaurants, Cajun\/Creole, Food, Salad, Seafood"},{"review_id":"Z_5lEpaQYd161yBRvFWyIA","business_id":"AP2UC4jid1vxI7Mu_Y1sXQ","stars_x":4.0,"date":1638329042000,"text":"The hours on this place are weird.

My partner and I got the margarita and Slip-n-fall golden ale, with the pork rillettes and cheesy egg rolls (with sweet chili remoulade waaaat?! So good). Then the phoritto (pho ingredients wrapped up like a burrito, if that isn't obvious). It came with a dipping sauce, and I was like no way is that a reduced pho broth, that would be too perfect, and it waaaas. Inhaled it all. Also got the Ahn Luu gives you wings. Whole wings (menu said 3, but came with 4) covered in a traditional Vietnamese sweet\/salty sauce with buku herbs, and side of rice noodles to soak up all that good good. ALSO everything came out lightning fast and hot. You could tell nothing was just sitting under a heat lamp. Our waitress was so cute and funny, and checked on us the perfect amount of times. THEN after our bill was paid, she came out with a free slice of king cake! It was devine, covered in a frosting with a hint of lime that was so unique. COVID Test: Tables were spaced out more than 6 feet, and we sat by huge garage type doors for good air circulation. No staff had lose masks or their noses out.

Of course they were fully committed but were trying to accommodate us. A couple was finishing up at the bar in the restaurant, so we decide to grab a drink by the Chandelier bar until those seats became available. We ordered the \"French 75\"& \"Cognac Nada Colada\". Both were very good. Soon after, we were able to grab seats at the bar in @missrivernola.\nEric was our server for the evening. He was pretty good, personable, and knowledgeable. \u00c2\u00a0The space was beautiful & very elegant. The bread served that night was sweet potato brioche, accompanied with the choice of oil, butter or my favorite honey. Oh child, we were definitely fighting over those little rolls LOL.\nFor our first course, we started with the \"Louisiana BBQ Shrimp\" & per Eric's recommendation the Gumbo. I hated the gumbo. The roux was much darker than I like, leaving it with a charred taste. The shrimp however was a hit. Nice size & I loved the pesto, green herb toast that was paired; gave it some nice flavor. We were told the kitchen was sending out a complementary \"Giardiniera Salad\" to make up for the gumbo. It was an iceberg salad, with a muttaletta like topping & Italian dressing. I do not eat olives so I was not crazy about it. Also, I later noticed we were charged for it. Something we didn't ask for. Now talk about leaving a bad taste in my mouth.\nMain course, we ordered the \"Redfish Courtbouillon\" & \"Prime Beef Ribeye\", added on a side of jasmine rice, roasted sweet potato, & collards. Honestly, I was very impressed how well those collards were cooked, & my steak was cooked perfectly. However, nothing else really wowed me.

Ya heard.  \nI love love love when businesses fill an actual need. From the mouths of the folks in the neighborhood a coffee shop in this location was a need. Also, it feels a need for me too as more folks are working from home it is nice to have a meeting place to offer that doesnt require them to come downtown.\nIf there was one word to describe Park Island it would be thoughtful.  From the reusable or recyclable to go cups, to the sourcing of the coffee, to the creative and regularly refreshed coffee concoctions they have really been thoughtful. \nThe customer service, chef's kiss. They always remind me to get my points. I've noticed true regulars have the orders remembered. Also, although during mornings it just one person working drinks and orders, lines are pretty decently taken care of.\nIf you are going to use this as a meeting space or work space do know that it can get full during obvious peak times. Also though the seating is sufficient it isnt the amount of say a Backatown or Coffee Science. I've always been able to get seating between 8am and 8:30am. But I have looked around at 9am and 9:30 and found just one indoor space left.\nSo, now that you have all my hot tips, go, get your life at Park Island Brew.","name":"Park Island Brew","address":"1686 Gentilly Blvd","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70119","stars_y":5.0,"review_count":48,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': True, 'validated': False, 'lot': False, 'valet': False}","OutdoorSeating":"True","WheelchairAccessible":"True","WiFi":"u'free'","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","Caters":"True","Alcohol":"u'none'"},"categories":"Coffee & Tea, Restaurants, Food, Cafes, Breakfast & Brunch, Ice Cream & Frozen Yogurt, Food Trucks"},{"review_id":"hueCq48llZzhh3ai1W2G9g","business_id":"JOTAQZPCqpD6Nr7dsN9MYA","stars_x":5.0,"date":1616464103000,"text":"Awesome omakase spot in NOLA.

We are all foodies that love, appreciate, and are willing to pay for good food and good atmosphere. We were super excited about not knowing what would be on the menu. The first course was a baked oyster, the second course was a butternut squash bisque with jumbo lump crab, and the third course was a tuna medley of sorts. These were all good, not the best food I've ever had, but nonetheless good food and very nicely presented. The following course was served as 5 pieces of sushi on a single plate. One was a very nice and creative Wagyu piece. The rest were mostly good, but a few days later, and I'm unable to recall what they were. The server, a very nice woman, asked if we liked any of the pieces. We said the Wagyu piece was very nice. So she brought an additional piece with no mention of an additional charge. Next up was an entree of Halibut, I believe. Again, not super memorable a few days later except for it was dry and over cooked, but we were hungry. So we ate it. We even swapped pieces to see if it was a singular piece that was over cooked... it was not. They were all over cooked. Next we were served a deconstructed apple pie. Nice, but again, not stellar and a bit underwhelming. Since the meal claimed to be 8-10 course, we started counting. The 5 pieces of sushi were considered 5 courses. We felt a bit duped and it felt like false advertising. For $89, we expected a course or two to be a bite or two, but not 5 to be a single piece of sushi. It felt really dishonest. Additionally when the check came out, the additional piece of Wagyu sushi was not in fact complimentary, but an additional $9 per piece.

One of the baristas recommended that to me and my friend when we went in and it was a delicious addition to the coffee! \n\nSecond, the service and ambience in this shop is always top tier.

Order a few of them! They also sell other beers and a beer flight.\n\nFood is fusion based as it's a blend of Cajun and Vietnamese cuisine and flavors. Your table is served chopsticks and utensils.\n\nStarted off with their Pickles & Pig plate and Cheesy Egg Rolls as apps for the table.\n\nPickles & Pig is pickled vegetables and crispy cracklin bites. It's actually fried char siu pork so it was a great nibble. Easily can be shared between 3-4 people.\n\nThe Cheesy Egg Rolls were delicious and perfect for any cheese lover. Think of these as airy mozzarella sticks. My only bit is that you'll need to order two of these as they only come in three's.\n\nOpted for the Fried Chicken Sandwich and this is not any regular chicken sandwich! It was a unique breading method as the chicken is done karaage style. Light and fluffy. I really should've ordered a second one.

She sounded like she didn't want to be there, didn't know the allergen information on the sauces, basically very rude tone from the very beginning. I told her my order, 9inch, traditional ny style, homemade pizza sauce ( i specifically asked if it had dairy in it because some do use dairy in it and she asked to make sure and said no) and some veggies. (keep this in mind for later) Me, being that I wanted to give this place a chance, I let it go and drove 15 minutes later to pick up the pizza. \nI get there and I wasn't greeted at all even though she was standing right in front of me and even looked at me and just asked \"you're here to pick up?\" I said yes and she went to go grab my order. I opened the box and long & behold there is cheese on the pizza. I told her I never said I wanted cheese on my pizza and she had the audacity to correct me and say that she took my order correctly on her piece of paper. I told her why would I ask for cheese pizza if i previously stated that I was lactose intolerant and even asked for clarification on the pizza sauce allergens. There was no pizza sauce at all on my pizza, just veggies and cheese. So I had to wait ALL over again for my order to be remade. 15 minutes later, I open my pizza box and there is still no pizza sauce on my pizza, instead there's BASIL PESTO. How they interpreted homemade pizza sauce to basil pesto, is just mind boggling. All three of the workers were just staring at me as if I was speaking another language, as if they did NOTHING WRONG. Not only did they not follow directions, but I really don't understand how you can work in the service industry, taking people's orders incorrectly, not once but TWICE. And to top it all off, their rudeness just put me off completely. Safe to say I will not be returning and will tell everyone I know not to visit this place. Spend your money elsewhere.

No one welcomed us, we were just met with blank stares. Whatever, we ordered two large sandwiches, one Steak and Cheese and the other was Brisket and Cheddar. It took them over 20 minutes to prepare two sandwiches. There was only one person who had ordered ahead of us, so I have no clue why it took that long to make two subs. There were at least six employees there, so staffing was not the issue. We eventually get our sandwiches, and they were terrible. They did not toast the bread, our sandwiches were made incorrectly and the quality of the meat was poor. To make a bad situation worse, both my husband and I experienced stomach pains within an hour after leaving. This was literally our first meal of the day, so there is no question as to what could have caused our discomfort. I'm just happy our toddler did not eat anything while we were here, so at least he was spared feeling ill. \n\nBelieve me when I say that you're better off going to Subway or any place that serves sandwiches for that matter.

Mr. Jeerasak is so kind -- he once graciously obliged to serve me pad thai at 10am from his food truck, a whole hour before they officially opened for business! --  and I was so excited to learn that he and his wife, Mrs. Suda were opening a brick-and-mortar, living example of \"mom and pop\" restaurant!\n\nWe dined in the casually romantic pink restaurant on a Friday night without making a reservation because we typically eat pretty early. I'd recommend making one though if you're going to dine at 6pm or later. Because we were early, we got to catch some of their happy hour specials. From the HH menu, we ordered the chicken sticks, veggie egg rolls, and shrimp and cheese rolls as part of the 3 mini apps for $10; the creamy Tom Yum soup for $5, and the roti with red curry sauce also for $5. Everything was delicious but oh my goodness, you have got to get the roti with the red curry sauce! The sauce is to dieeee for! \n\nFor our actual meals, we got the egg fried rice and veggie pad thai with no tofu cooked at a medium spice level. Whew, that medium spicy is something good, yall! It was a tad spicy even for my Indian palette so I'd recommend going for mild and asking for sriracha on the side in case you don't wanna wrestle with your GERD later on in the night. All of this was washed down with some Singha beer, served with a frosted glass, of course! \n\nOn a previous occasion, I picked up two veggie pad thais to go and they were packaged really well.

This highly anticipated restaurant in the new Four Seasons hotel at the foot of Canal Street has everything going for it - pleasant d\u00c3\u00a9cor, well-regarded chef Alon Shaya, a decent menu concept - but it completely underwhelmed. On our first visit we gently complained to the server how their Open Table listing never showed reservation availability other than 2:30 and that they did not respond to multiple emails asking for a dinner reservation on our anniversary (the manager later explained that they leave most tables available for hotel guests). The menu was limited, perhaps because they had recently opened and we were still in pandemic so I ordered a fish dish - usually a safe bet in this seafood mecca. Nope! It was actually bad! At first it tasted simply over-salted but after a second bite I concluded it was a bad piece of fish. When the server saw I had barely touched it she offered to exchange it for something else, which I accepted. To their credit, the manager later stopped by and said he wanted to comp our entire meal - an excellent service recovery. Feeling guilty about their generosity we returned a month later to give them another try, and again we were underwhelmed. Even though service had just started, staff were romping all around the dining room moving things, putting things away and generally being a distraction. Weird pop music was playing, not in sync with the classy vibe of the place. Though friendly and polite, the servers lacked the polish you'd expect in a high-end place like this. And the food was nothing special and cost easily twice what you'd pay elsewhere in town. We texted our impressions to the manager (who had previously given us his contact info), he thanked us for our feedback and said he'd discuss these issues with his staff. Sorry in this town, TWO strikes and you're out. I hate to see a restaurant fail, so hopefully this one will get enough traffic from out-of-towners (the aforementioned hotel guests) to stay afloat.","name":"Miss River Restaurant","address":"2 Canal St","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70130","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":22,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Ambience":"{u'divey': False, u'hipster': False, u'casual': False, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': False, u'intimate': False, u'romantic': False, u'classy': True, u'upscale': False}"},"categories":"Desserts, Restaurants, Cajun\/Creole, Food, Salad, Seafood"},{"review_id":"gEZsCSiF3dG-8FKLatvVMw","business_id":"uOg4ibVUHlEXspv9ikvvJQ","stars_x":5.0,"date":1628131531000,"text":"Absolutely loved it.

Table service is coordinated like the symphony orchestra. \n\nThe espresso martinis were a special of the night but I intend to ask for these   on my next visit regardless. Kent, behind the bar, made an excellent Sazarac and La Louisiana (he described this as a notch up from the Sazarac) from my +1 while we waited for our table. \n\nAdditionally, the decor is stunning all over -- from the bathroom to the bar to the tables. Unfortunately, there is not much of an outdoor view to appreciate but I had my sweetheart across from me so that's all I needed. \n\nNow, on to the food. We had the mini seafood tower (a good amount of food for two people), the gumbo which is served with white rice (cooked in bacon stock) and potato salad (get your Louisiana on whatever way you like it!), oyster stew, butter pecan pie with ice cream, and of course, delicious bread!\n\nWe found our bill was quite reasonable for the exceptional experience we had.

I wanted to go on the weekend of my birthday, except Baton Rouge experienced a freeze in the beginning of the week which wasn't pleasant and threw off all of my plans.\n\nWell I finally got to try Yo Nashi last night and I'm honestly disappointed. I've read the reviews about how the owner says it's a \"New Orleans omakase, not a Japanese style omakase\", but I wasn't expecting so much cooked food. The flavors were a bit lackluster with the exception of two or three courses. Two of my biggest complaints is that we were served red snapper twice as I have never been served the same fish twice during an omakase dinner (red snapper plain, then red snapper with caviar...), and that the final course was bland and tasteless. I managed to get photos of everything except for the ora king salmon nigiri because I was just too hungry.\n\nThe verdict is that I wouldn't come back. I had very high hopes for Yo Nashi, but This isn't my first rodeo, and I've never left hungry after omakase like I did here, especially for a similar price point. I've always been at least satisfied or actually very full. Unfortunately, we ended up going to another spot after to fill our bellies and satisfy our cravings.","name":"Yo Nashi","address":"419 Carondelet St, Ste 101","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70130","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":40,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","HasTV":"False","Caters":"False","BikeParking":"True","WiFi":"u'no'","RestaurantsReservations":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"True","OutdoorSeating":"False","WheelchairAccessible":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"False"},"categories":"Sushi Bars, Japanese, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"h04N0an5eZFlijewJXyjOQ","business_id":"yxXC3ygX6cfW9GgP-CaKQg","stars_x":4.0,"date":1640836033000,"text":"Food tastes good and the venue itself looks nice.

The menu is mostly Italian food with some good fish and meat options. They were having a $2 beer special on some random bottles so I got a hoegaarden. We shared a caesar salad which was overdressed and nothing special. By this time, we had 3 waiters approach us and ask if we were ready to order. We were sitting at the high tops, which was open seating, so seems like the wait staff is less organized on the bar side. I asked the waiter for a recommendation and she suggested the eggplant parmesan so I got that. My fiance got the black drum. My eggplant parmesan had too much breading and the marinara sauce they make is very sweet - too much for my taste. My fiance's black drum was tasty but the side portions were pretty small. At this point, the crowd that was starting to walk in was older.

I seriously felt like having a glass of whiskey with a cigarette after the meal because it was that good. I don't even smoke cigarettes but I'd happily light one just to have a Pulp Fiction moment to show my gratitude to the chef. By far one of the best meals I've had in New Orleans.\n\nYou are coming here for an experience that will blow your damn mind away and over stimulate your taste buds. Yo Nashi is an omakase restaurant, so think of it as multiple tastings with set courses decided by the chef and their team. \n\nI highly recommend grabbing a reservation ahead of time because this is a very intimate experience. You're sitting right across from the chef and their team as all the chairs are against the \"sushi bar\" for a total of maybe 15 seats at most. The dark tones of the restaurant create a cozy atmosphere perfect to catch up with friends you haven't seen in a moment or a special meal for whatever the reason may be.\n\nFreaking A, the smells coming from the kitchen y'all. Seeing their team in action and how strategic they were with plating was surreal. Every dish presented to us was divine. I really loved the spacing and teaming of each bite as you were able to enjoy genuine conversations with your \"table\".\n\nWhat I'm still dreaming about to this day (no seriously, I probably have a daily thought about this meal) were the cuts of tuna, fish, and bluefin. The chef informed us they had actually caught it fresh and it seriously tasted like we were on the gulf coast ourselves. Ever piece of sushi or sashimi was SO F*@#ING GOOD. It seriously melted in your mouth and I'm not even exaggerating about that.\n\n***One thing you'll really walk away from your dining experience is how the chef breaks down each tasting and conveys the cooking process and ingredients in a way that even the most novice of eaters can understand. This isn't a pretentious restaurant or undermines those who might not be fully versed. It was such a refreshing personality of a restaurant of this caliber to have!\n\nSo a few dishes I actually remembered to write down were (don't forget it's omakase style so don't expect all of these to be featured when you dine in, most likely will rotate or differ due to chefs inspiration\/taste when you go in):\n\n-Heirloom Tomato Gazpacho: Super light and refreshing. Adorable presentation!\n-Red Snapper Sashimi: HELL YES. I can't explain it any other way lol. It had pickled beets and radishes which complimented it perfectly.\n-Spiced Crusted Bluefin Tuna: literally a euphoric moment in your mouth. Melted in your mouth.\n-Lemon Fish: had toasted avocado and sesame seeds. I'm not even a fan of avocado and I enjoyed this.\n-Wagyu: This was an extra $$ add-on but for the love of foodies, DO IT IF IT IS AVAILABLE. It had chanterelle mushrooms and corned cream sauce. I seriously shed a happy tear because I was blown away by it. I took my time with this dish because I wanted to savor every moment with it.\n\nWe probably had at least 12+ tastings and it was nicely wrapped up with a dessert. I should've licked the dessert plate clean tbh. It was light and had blueberries and a lemon based shortcake.\n\nI'm coming back. I have to come back. Someone please take me back to Yo Nashi.","name":"Yo Nashi","address":"419 Carondelet St, Ste 101","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70130","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":40,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","HasTV":"False","Caters":"False","BikeParking":"True","WiFi":"u'no'","RestaurantsReservations":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"True","OutdoorSeating":"False","WheelchairAccessible":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"False"},"categories":"Sushi Bars, Japanese, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"Whp9orsmScJCCrxxYrvKCw","business_id":"AP2UC4jid1vxI7Mu_Y1sXQ","stars_x":5.0,"date":1622763724000,"text":"They are here and hopefully to stay.

Warmed up well.  Fresh tortilla and all the ingredients from a beef pho. Came with a roux-style pho dippin' sauce - heaven! \nSpring rolls: Fresh delicious huge rolls of happiness. The secret ingredient (apple) makes these stand out. \n\nIn addition to the fantastic food, the service was impeccable.  The ambiance has a \"we've been here forever and we care about our restaurant\" feel, even though they've just opened.

I consider that brilliant and a big attraction. And while without those appreciated pictures, make sure you wait to hear the specials for the day before making a decision! Chances are, they will be something really tasty and appealing. \nAnother standout quality is the staff. Everyone treated the restaurant and each of the customers as they were personally invested in success of the business and the experience of the guests. That's a pretty impressive quality. Our glasses were never empty, no questions were unanswered and we were engaged with at all the right times. Friendly, but efficient. \n\nSuggestions: \nWe had each of the appetizers, and they were all fantastic (even the tofu and in not usually into that). Everything was cooked great, but the sauces are what really turned things up from good to great. Salad Roll is good and Papaya Salad was great (but don't get overly brave when it comes to temptation of getting Thai Spicy vs. medium...it catches up with you by the end). Most main dishes come with protein and spice level options, but the team will be  happy to guide you through any decision making and seemed very accommodating to dietary restrictions of multiple variations.\nA thing to know, is that parking is in the back of the building. Back entrance also features the handicap ramp and while accessible, most of the lot is gravel with those embedded pattern shapes, so may not be the easiest to navigate in a wheelchair or with a stroller, so plan accordingly or make sure you park closer to the cement slab. \n\nOverall, great experience!

While he was inside, I noticed that if you check-in on Yelp you can get a free cookie! I called Matt in a hurry and to fill him in on the Yelp swag and he managed to check-in and snag one before they finished making our sandwich. I'm so glad he did because their cookies are absolutely delicious! Not too hard, not too soft and filled with lots of chocolate chunks- what's not to love? We devoured our cookie on the ride home, and couldn't wait to dig into our sandwich. Well let me tell you, the Steak and Cheese did not disappoint. The bread was perfectly toasted, and the steak was thin and well seasoned. It also had an excellent ratio of steak to bell pepper. It held up extremely well on our 10 minute drive home, so I can only imagine it would be even better if we had the chance to dine in. \n\nMatt reported that the service he received was very friendly and that all of the employees greeted him when he arrived.

Perhaps if you sit at Cracker Barrel and eat their large chicken fried steak weekly you could leave Yo Nashi hungry. However, it was 10 portions served with the utmost attention to detail and flavor. Chef Mack was a great guy. I asked a ton of questions as I think all people who love food should. He mentioned he had worked at Commanders and it showed. I can't say enough how his attention to detail made the meal extravagant. As we left I told him it was in my Top 10 meals ever and that is not an exaggeration. Their prefix menu was $89 which I must admit I thought was high but now I'm ready to go back!  They offered A5 Wagyu beef as an additional option but we backed out on that. \n\nNow to the actual meal. Amber was gracious enough to write it all down for me so I could include it in this review. I had noticed numerous posts without a description. So here goes......\n1) fresh oysters with satsuma mignonette\n2)Poached Shrimp with grilled green onion sauce \n3)Seared scallops over cauliflower pur\u00c3\u00a9e\nNigiri servings:\n4)Salmon w\/ sesame ponzu\n5)seared halibut w\/ black garlic and miso \n6))Spicy tuna.....OMG. The best!!!!!!! (I had an extra)\n7)Tuna w\/ foie Gras and truffle \n8)Jumbo lump blue crab roll (two pieces)\n9)Pan seared redfish w\/sweet potato chestnut mushrooms, lobster beurre Blanc\n10) Chocolate trio w\/expresso meringue and hazelnut crumble \n\nSo yeah, tons of food. All crafted and served with perfection. Truly a great dining experience that I will treasure until my next visit. I'll let the pictures help seal the deal. Don't hesitate to add this place to your list of dining adventures in NOLA. In a city with 100's of incredible options this will be in your top tier.

Every time I eat at one of his restaurants I am really impressed. I always recommend his restaurants for friends from out of town. So, I had high expectations.\n\nWhen walking into the hotel, you see a beautiful chandelier bar. I didn't get drinks here but it look really nice. Since I went for lunch, it wasn't very crowded. I liked that because it wasn't too loud. I was also celebrating a family members birthday, so as we got to our table they had a cute gold balloon and a handwritten happy birthday card. Such a cute touch! \n\nWhile you are getting situated and looking at the menu, the waiter brings out sweet potato rolls that were actually amazing. They were warm and came with 3 things to dip the bread in -- olive oil, butter, and chili infused honey \n\nTo start we got the blue crab au gratin (which we were told was best selling) and the oysters en brouchette. Both were delicious. The blue crab came with these saltines that were seasoned or something (I forgot what they had on them but they tasted better than a regular saltine). The oysters came with bread and a little salad of jalape\u00c3\u00b1o and cilantro. I honestly think the bread was a little dry and not really needed and the jalape\u00c3\u00b1os were too spicy for the dish. It completely overpowered the flavor of the oysters. But I hate spicy stuff so maybe other people will like it. \n\nAs an entree I got the blackened snapper that was recommended by the waiter. It was really good. It came on top of some roasted squash with a citrus sauce on top. I really liked it. I also needed something with substance so I also ordered a side of French fries. They came with 3 dipping sauces -- ketchup, garlic aioli, and a horseradish aioli. The fries were good and I liked how it came out with 3 dipping sauces. \n\nTo finish, I got an expresso martini that was quite good but not like amazing. I like a more coffee flavor but I still drank it all. After you eat, they give you a few little treats and we got these little brownies and banana pralines. I didn't try the praline but the brownies were good. They also gave us a complimentary piece of chocolate cake for the birthday we were celebrating. \n\n\nSo you may be wondering, why 4 stars? Well, since I have eaten at all of the other Alon Shaya restaurants in NOLA, this one was just as good as the other ones but Miss River is way more expensive. I know the four seasons is a really fancy hotel but if you want to get food by chef Alon Shaya you are better off going to one of his other places and your bill will be significantly lower. The menu had a MKT price for the blue crab au gratin but when the bill came it was $45. $45?! I don't think that was worth $45. It probably wouldn't be best selling if people saw it was a $45 appetizer. I am glad I tried it but this place will probably be where the hotel guests will dine because they don't know any better.","name":"Miss River Restaurant","address":"2 Canal St","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70130","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":22,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Ambience":"{u'divey': False, u'hipster': False, u'casual': False, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': False, u'intimate': False, u'romantic': False, u'classy': True, u'upscale': False}"},"categories":"Desserts, Restaurants, Cajun\/Creole, Food, Salad, Seafood"},{"review_id":"mc2Ou_t7mBrwpJktRWYvTA","business_id":"AP2UC4jid1vxI7Mu_Y1sXQ","stars_x":5.0,"date":1612392211000,"text":"Amazing beer selections (they brew their own), wonderful Vietnamese food and lovely atmosphere plus Kate the server is fun, fun, fun!!

I've eaten Chinese food from every mentionable city in the USA - NOLA just doesn't have it. I currently live in Uptown and every place I've ordered from has been subpar to say the least. Until I came here.\n\nOne rainy Saturday night, while visiting a family member hospitalized at Oschner and too exhausted (lazy) to go out, I decided to order delivery from this place. Within 30 minutes from the time I placed the call, I had two steaming hot takeout containers filled with shrimp and broccoli, chicken lo mein, and shrimp fried rice, along with a cup of hot and sour soup, delivered to my room (they brought it straight to my ROOM, ya'll) at the Brent House Hotel. \n\nFirst off, don't listen to these other reviewers. I've noticed that some Yelpers love mentioning details that are completely irrelevant and don't pertain to the quality and taste of the food, when I'm pretty sure that's the most important part of a review (e.g; solicited by a bum and somehow that's the restaurant\/employee's fault? Seriously??)\n\nAnyway, back to quality and taste - the food was amazing!! The shrimp were HUGE and fresh! My veggies were super crunchy, Lo mein noodles were delicious, and the fried rice had the perfect ratio of sauce\/veggies to rice (not salty at all)! Now if this place could deliver all the way to Uptown, it would be a dream come true!! 10\/10 would recommend - I'll be driving across town next time I'm in the mood for some good Chinese!","name":"Chinese American Cafe","address":"1228 Jefferson Hwy","city":"New Orleans","state":"LA","postal_code":"70121","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":34,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","WiFi":"'no'","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","GoodForKids":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","OutdoorSeating":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"False","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","Alcohol":"u'none'","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"False","Ambience":"{'romantic': False, 'intimate': False, 'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'divey': False, 'classy': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'casual': False}","DogsAllowed":"False","Caters":"True"},"categories":"Restaurants, Chinese"},{"review_id":"RvYPIGslr9HwCbwUJ26i8A","business_id":"xFk0apIOljR2DL5Zj-VNOA","stars_x":4.0,"date":1393977868000,"text":"I've have only eaten take out from here so I cannot really speak to the ambience or the waitstaff.

Walking in, there were a few tables and I saw a section for drinks and a sauce bar. The cashier is to the right when walking in. I placed my order fairly quickly and once I was done paying and picked a table to sit at, my order was already finished. That seemed oddly fast for me. We ordered 2 orders of rock tacos and 2 cokes. \n\nThe food was underwhelming. It was room lukewarm and not hot at all. Didn't seem fresh to me. The sauce bar has a lot of variety, but I couldn't distinguish a lot of the sauces. There's a board that tells you the names and heat level, but on the sauces itself, there is no label of indication. The consome had steam coming out, but it was also barely warm. I was pretty disappointed having heard so many great reviews. I felt like the tacos were missing something. They weren't the most flavorful, but not bland either. I'm not sure what it was missing. One of the best sauces was I think an avocado sauce. It was a thicker light green color and was really good. I didn't really like any of the other sauces. \n\nService was fast and the workers were really friendly. Our order came out to about $22. Not too bad. Maybe my visit was a fluke.

I was promptly greeted by the staff and handed a menu. The menu is simple, not a lot of options, which is good because it forced you to order quickly. I ordered the birria, which is a burrito wrapped in a standard flour tortilla but then it's wrapped up in a layer of grilled cheese. It was essentially a grilled cheese burrito with the content of beef, rice, and beans inside. It also comes with a side of ramen, which is so interesting, since I've never heard or seen of ramen + Hispanic food coming together. The burrito is huge, so come hungry. Also I personally feel like the layer of grilled cheese is a lot and makes the meal heavier. I had to scrape off half of the cheese off, then I felt it was proportionally appropriate and I was able to get a good bite of rice, cheese, etc. It was extremely flavorful. \n\nI also ordered the quesadilla with brisket, or the 'penny' according the menu. They overly stuffed this quesadilla and I felt the brisket was on the drier side. I had to add sour cream from home to balance the dryness. There's also a salsa bar which is pretty cool and the sign shows the volume of heat for each salsa. I was pretty much a sissy because I thought the tomatillo was too spicy! \n\nOverall good experience with good food and friendly staff. My only critique besides the brisket being on the drier side was that majority of the staff did not wear masks.

The employees at our hotel kept recommending this place so my fianc\u00c3\u00a9 and I went as soon as Ida cleared and places opened up. We tried it 2x to have a honest review lol\n\nSome things I would say is their trompo meat could be seasoned way more all u taste is the sweet from the pineapple. As well as upgrading both corn and flour tortillas for a more authentic taste. Their \"guacamole \" is just smashed avocado with no salt or lime.\n\nI love their arachera meat, the penny quesadilla w meat, the Rock taco with the consom\u00c3\u00a9. I like that they have all toppings individually wrapped It keeps it sanitary and fresh. The Margaritas are delicious!!!

(I'm behind the trend, I know.) So I put in a to-go order of Rock tacos and a side soft shell steak taco to try them out. Overall, I'd have to say it was ok. The pork in the Rock tacos was flavored well and they did not skimp on meat; also, 3 medium sized tacos for $8.50 isn't bad at all! However, I was disappointed with the consome broth...it had no flavor to me! I ended up using the side dipping sauces to add flavor. And the steak taco was meh. Not that my expectations are super high for a flour tortilla with meat, onions, and cilantro, but the meat was super tough and dry and not very flavorful. So, overall, I believe  that this spot is good as \"chain\" taco restaurant, and some dishes are probably higher quality than others.

It's a neat open concept eatery with the cooking done in full-view of the customers.\n\nI purchased a shrimp version of their Dog Burrito (~$11 regular price), and it was fantastic! The cheese on the outside of the burrito had been grilled to perfection. Slightly burnt cheesy goodness adds that savory umami flavor on a soft tortilla to create a little corner of heaven in your mouth. The shrimp, beans, and Spanish rice were well-seasoned, and the raw onions and cilantro added a bit of zest.  Really delicious burrito!  It was also huge, so perfect for me to split with someone if I'm having other foods with it!\n\nThey have a selection of hot sauces and extras (pickles and some toppings) you can try as well.  Let me tell you, the hot sauces were no joke. I tried a few and they were HOT.  Fun extra though if you're into heat!\n\nI also tried a tamarind flavored soda. I like that distinct tamarind taste! That was yummy, but a little bit pricy (~$3).\n\nI also got to try their Birria Ramen complimentary as a Yelp Elite Perk.  This was disappointing if you were actually expecting ramen. It was more like a beef noodle soup (instead of a chicken noodle soup).  The noodles were not quality ramen noodles.  I thought it might be the instant kind that you can cook in the microwave. The broth was beefy and flavorful, but it was too salty - maybe it wasn't a good batch.  The beef was only partially edible for me since it contained a lot of blubbery pieces (some people like beef fat, but I don't).  All in all, the ramen was not good.  They have other great food here, don't try ramen at a taco place.  Although I will say, I AM Japanese and a self-proclaimed ramen snob, so you can take my opinions with a grain of salt!  Like I said, this is a taco place, so I won't take any stars off for this.\n\nThe one-star loss actually comes from the lack of masks on the staff.

The coffee was distinct. With subtle hints of sweetness that reminded me of maple flavor. The egg omelette was large and packed with spinach, mushrooms, peppers, onions, and tomatoes. The grits were cooked perfectly. Creamy and just the right amount of salt. However a side of grits was $7! Seems a bit over priced in my opinion but I ordered and ate it anyways. The side of catfish was superb. It was fried lightly, with the right amount of crunch and seasoned well. I'll be back again to try some more menu items and have a cocktail or two. \n\nNo parking lot.
