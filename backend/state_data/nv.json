We showed up at 10:50am on Sunday and sign says doesn't open till 11am, which i can respect so I waited in my car till 11am and then I go to the door and the lights are still out and it appears that an employee had just arrived and she is giving my wife and I the one minute signal through the window. We stand outside and wait, mind you it's winter and cold. We wait a couple minutes outside and then a second employee arrived and says to us \"it's not open yet\"? The  employee inside lets the other one in and proceeds to tell us to wait longer in which it is 11:05 at this time and none of the veggies and sandwich meat had been out so we decided to go somewhere else. They could have at least allowed us to wait inside. Clearly punctuality is not important to the employees of this store.","name":"Quiznos","address":"2905 Northtowne Ln, Ste 120","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89512","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":32,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BikeParking":"True","Caters":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","HasTV":"False","Alcohol":"u'none'","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","OutdoorSeating":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","GoodForKids":"True","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","DriveThru":"False","WiFi":"u'no'","WheelchairAccessible":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","BYOB":"False","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': True}","BusinessAcceptsBitcoin":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"True","Corkage":"False","DogsAllowed":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': True, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","RestaurantsTableService":"False"},"categories":"Restaurants, Sandwiches, Salad, Fast Food, Soup, Delis"},{"review_id":"PpLxzK-nVBH8oLq6JEsryg","business_id":"z3MQ4dmYICABaayF66NV3A","stars_x":4.0,"date":1416008177000,"text":"Go here all the time for the chicken carbonara.

Pull up a chair and stay awhile, because it is SO good to have you here!\n\nThis spot was on our radar long before it opened, mostly because of location (close neighborhood bar FTW!), but also because of what appeared to be a rockstar menu, one that we knew would thwart our efforts of choosing the BEST thing on it. Too many good things! From the apps to the salads and burgers to the long list of yummy entrees, Old Southwest has curated a tasty menu that proves impossible to choose from. So we had to go a half dozen times to try as much as possible!\n\nSo far, I have to say that the bacon & Brussels sprouts app is one of my favorite things ever! It know... it's vegetables, on the app menu, but it is SO GOOD! The portion is gigantic, Brussels cooked to perfection (fried I think, yum!), and this balsamic glaze drizzled all over it that just puts everything over the top. \n\nAnother one of the menu items that I would specifically visit this spot for is the Poutine. OMG, poutine with tater tots sounds blasphemous, I know - but it is AMAZING. Super crispy well-seasoned tots, house made steak\/bacon gravy (!!!), cheesy cheese curds melting all over... it's a hungover Canadian's dream! And again, the portion is ridiculous, completely and utterly shareable. I seriously tell everyone I know about this dish because it's so epic!\n\nMore items that are worth tasting - seared ahi app, Thai chicken salad, and the fish fries (basically fish + chips.) The thing is, we keep going back expecting to find something we don't like, but everything has been, at the bare minimum, tasty! On top of that, we've always have excellent service in a nice chill atmosphere. They have machines if gaming is your thing, but it still doesn't feel like a sports bar - plenty of windows, natural light, and a small yet modern space to hang out. \n\nWhen it comes to great food, a fun environment, and awesome service with a smile, Old Southwest nails it every time.

There's something about the flaky dough and rich, often stew like filling that's just so satisfying and soul soothing. \n\nWhen I heard about EmPienada my heart went a flutter, and I finally had the chance to try them vis the food truck at the NYEP Fall Festival at Bartley Ranch. \n\nMy wife got one of the combo deals and since we decided to eat late, the choices were more limited than we'd have liked. We tried the French onion and the vegetable fajita empanadas, along with their fried stuffed potato balls. The meal came with three dipping sauces, curry mustard, herb sour cream and a spicy aioli.  \n\nThe French onion was creative and surprisingly delicious. It had all the hallmarks of a good French onion soup, from rich beef broth flavor, tender onions, and melty stringy cheese. The flaky pastry was the perfect sub for the crouton! The veggie fajita was good as well with vibrant fresh veggies in a southwestern flavored sauce inside the flaky pastry. A solid vegetarian option.\n\nNow the potato balls aka croquettes (at least to me) were delicious. Well seasoned bread crumbs created a golden brown crust around soft and pillowy mashed potatoes that had a delicious filling in the middle. After a dunk in any of the sauces you were off to the next level.\n\nIt was a warm day, so maybe not the ideal conditions for this type of food, but it went down easy. We did enjoy it, but personally it's not the kind of food I can reach for repeatedly. That may not be the case for everyone though, and if this is your jam, then you will love EmPienada.\n\nAs for me, I need to try more variety from them.

The sauces were also bland and didn't really add to anything. \n\nService was so good and the staff were really nice though, so I'm willing to give it another try.","name":"emPIEnada","address":"3683 Kings Row","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89503","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":41,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Caters":"True","BikeParking":"True","Alcohol":"u'none'","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","WheelchairAccessible":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"},"categories":"Event Planning & Services, Restaurants, Empanadas, Caterers, Food, Desserts, Comfort Food, American (Traditional), Food Trucks"},{"review_id":"K9TIlUcsk9JUydpXY5sKtQ","business_id":"saY6vCt-GsDfh6QYAA3WYQ","stars_x":5.0,"date":1641956858000,"text":"Ashley was our waitress and was such a nice addition to the great food we ate.

On this night, we gave Old Southwest Social House a try and it definitely has some good points, but also some things to work on. \n\nThe atmosphere is great, modern, clean, and with plenty of seating at the bar and in the restaurant. We were there at kind of an off-time (~3pm), so we were able to snag two seats at the bar without a problem. The service was friendly, and the bartender was willing to give honest recommendations of what she thought we would enjoy (or not, apparently the ham-and-cheese pocket is a no-go in her opinion). Unfortunately, they were out of the first beer that we wanted and our second choice kicked after our first one--leading us to our third choice beer. When we got the check, the pints were $10 each (yikes!). \n\nThe story falls apart with the food. We started with the spinach and caramelized onion dip, which had an okay flavor but didn't really taste like onions of any kind, much less caramelized onions. It tasted a lot like spinach and artichoke dip, and came out pretty thin--we needed to wait awhile before it was dip-able and by then it wasn't hot. The chips served with it, however, were delicious! I got a burger, which was well-done instead of medium, under-seasoned, and ended up being pretty pricey once I added cheese. The fries were only sort of hot and were not crispy, but chewy instead (sad!).

It's taken a while to get here, as our pups' vet and groomers are located in this strip center, but this will certainly be in our regular rotation.\n\nAfter checking out the reviews on Yelp! I scanned the pix for the menu, as the website doesn't list ingredients.  I placed the order online Monday for a Tuesday afternoon pickup (pups at the groomers).  Ordered the chicken and the beef\/Guinness pot pie as well as a beef\/mushroom and pork\/yam empanada.  Super easy to do, just remember that the pies are usually made fresh and take about an hour...so keep that in mind...perfection takes time!!).  Without fail, the pups were done 2 hours early, so called to see if we could move the order up.  They said they had the chicken ready, but the beef\/Guinness would take about an hour.  So they offered the Gumbo in exchange, which they had ready for inventory.  The empanadas only take about 8 minutes to make.  That worked great for us.\n\nThe place is set up for take out only, though there are picnic tables set up that are shared with another eatery.  You walk into the place and you are hit by the savory smells of fresh baking pies (they should make a candle in this scent!!).  Very helpful, friendly staff and had my order ready to go in minutes.  Had to ask how to reheat non-frozen pies (300 degrees for about 30 minutes, though a meat thermometer is highly suggested, as the pies are fully cooked and just need to be heated to serving temperature).  Smelled so good in the car they almost didn't make it home!\n\nUnless your ravenous, the pies are easily sharable, as are the empanadas.  These are real pot pies, with flakey, buttery crust encasing the fillings.  We had the chicken pot pie along with the beef\/mushroom empanada.  More than enough for the 2 of us for dinner.  After popping them in the oven for around 20 minutes, they were hot and ready.  The pot pie filling was absolutely delicious, complimented by the savory crust.  Filled with onions, carrots, celery, corn, peas and lots of chicken.  The beef\/mushroom empanada is encased in a black sesame dough, filled with beef, mushrooms and peas in a dark savory gravy.  Again, perfect size for dinner...though I could have easily overeaten, it was soooo gooood!!!\n\nWe'll have the other pie and empanada for dinner tonight.  2 dinners for under $30 with the taste of homemade.  Yeah, we'll be back to try the other items.  \n\nHighly recommend this place as a regular go-to.","name":"emPIEnada","address":"3683 Kings Row","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89503","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":41,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Caters":"True","BikeParking":"True","Alcohol":"u'none'","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","WheelchairAccessible":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}"},"categories":"Event Planning & Services, Restaurants, Empanadas, Caterers, Food, Desserts, Comfort Food, American (Traditional), Food Trucks"},{"review_id":"0do9idR-AXQRnlDPAvq1Ng","business_id":"saY6vCt-GsDfh6QYAA3WYQ","stars_x":3.0,"date":1638669591000,"text":"Love having a nice local bar \/ pub in the neighborhood.

They do have a food truck that makes it rounds but your best shot at their full menu is right here at their brick n mortar location!\n\nTheir empanadas are made fresh and thoughtfully - every one has its own unique dough and generously seasoned fillings. Some come with their own special dipping sauce. Others are absolutely perfect on their own.\n\nI have to first and foremost point you to the Chicken and Waffles empanada with syrup to dip in. It takes a classic flavor and makes it like a hundred times better! The chicken is moist and plentiful... dough is light and crispy... the syrup ties it all together. It is the thing that Brunch dreams are made of!\n\nYou can't go wrong with any of their pork items. It's just so tender and flavorful! See: Pork & Sweet Potato and their newest empanada, the Cuban (which is INSANE with their house-made Citrus Mustard! Like I said - sorcery.) There's this fun Cheeseburger one with a sauce that makes it taste EXACTLY like a cheeseburger, just with a freakin' phenomenal paprika-spiked dough. My man has a very special place in his heart for the Beef and Mushroom empanada as well. \n\nSo I'm basically just listing off their entire menu, but the thing is that we've never had a bad empanada here.

My daughter and I had the vegetable pies and, while the inside ingredients were hot, the outside crust was a bit doughy and could have used a few more minutes in the oven. \n\nI am happy to support this new take-out business as they work out some kinks.

Imagine for a moment, dear reader, that you took beef broth and watered it down. Then you watered that down. Then you dumped that into a lake, and took a ladle and scooped up the lake water au jus.

They have a small entry and order area we believe because the rest is for food processing. The menu is on the wall behind the counter and they have paper menus as well. There is no inside seating but there is what appears to be shared outside seating, some under cover, with other establishments. We were told that they have been in this location for about two months and they also have a food truck. We had heard of their food truck as well.\n\nWe placed our orders avoiding pot pies which take about 1 hour to cook. The empanada's are smaller and cook in about 8 minutes.\n\nBoth of us chose the Cheeseburger empanada and we decided to try a large order of the three cheese macaroni balls which consists of 8 balls verses 4 balls for the small order. \u00c2\u00a0My wife also decided to try the banana chocolate empanada as a sweet treat.\n\nEverything was so tasty and interesting.

My wife chose the Classic Chicken and I chose the Italian Meatball. \u00c2\u00a0Both were packaged very well and we are excited to try them.\n\nWe cooked the Classic Chicken pot pie a day later and we both thought it was amazing! Chicken, peas, corn, carrots, flaky crust. The directions said to cook at 400 for an hour but we added 10 more minutes.

Unfortunately, I could not find the spinach  and artichoke empanada on their menu, although all their other menu items are listed. When I arrived, the food was waiting for me and the pickup process was really smooth. The girls behind the counter were really nice and the whole process was so easy. \n\nOnce we got home, the food was still hot and crisp. The pot pies had little symbols on top to indicate which were which, but I wish the boxes were labeled cause it was a little hard to decipher the symbols after the baking process. I think this is a cute concept, but the meatball pie filling had overflowed a bit in the cooking process and you couldn't tell what the symbol was at all.. \n\nOnce we dug in, everything was delicious. The empanadas were large and stuffed with a good amount of filling. I wish the cheeseburger one was cheesier, but the beef and mushroom was super flavorful and the pork and sweet potato was a surprising flavor combo with curry spices. And the sauce line up adds a little extra oomph to each bite. I really enjoyed the spicy Mayo and their pickled onions. \n\nThe risotto balls needed a little salt, but the loaded mash balls were so dang good. Definitely the best balls that we ordered. \n\nOverall the food was really good, but the prices are on the higher side.

I might be back to pick up a frozen one (or two)...but that's about it. \nMy friend and I went last week. With snow in the forecast, we thought it would be good to stock up, so we ordered 4 empanadas (one as a combo deal, with a side included - we chose the 3 cheese mac 'n cheese balls) and two pot pies - one frozen (chicken) and one hot\/ready to go (gumbo). Both pot pies were delicious! And super filling - one is definitely enough for two people or at least two meals for one person. \n\nAs far as the balls go - sadly, we didn't get them. We should have checked the order before leaving but it took 25 minutes to be ready instead of the 10-15 they said, so we were hungry! and ready to go - we waited outside because it's such a small space for customers, but it was freezing out there. Not ideal. \n\nHad we checked the bags, we also may have noticed that we didn't get any saucs with our empanadas...which may have changed how we felt about them. Which was underwhelmed. \nFirst of all, we ordered four different kinds, but our pork and sweet potato empanada (what! could have been incredible!) was mistakenly replaced with a second chicken empanada....we are guessing they were both the chicken and waffle we ordered, but detected no hint of waffle. One seemed to be coated with powdered sugar, so at first we wondered if a blueberry pie empanada had mistakenly been included - nope, just a very sweet chicken empanada. That was weird. \n\nWe really like the Cuban empnada! But the cheeseburger empanada was disappointing as well. It was basically a bunch of ground beef, without any other ingredients (that we could taste) to make it actually resemble cheeseburger. Maybe our high hopes got in the way here. \n\nOur total was $55 for all of this and since we didn't get some of what we ordered and got the wrong order for others...not great. The pot pies were good - so maybe stick to those and you'll be ok.

I think the honey garlic sauce was used on both types of chicken, and then the sesame chicken had some seeds on top. I'll admit that I ordered the Honey Garlic Chicken as a risk, but I figured the Sesame Chicken would be safe choice. Not this time! However, I did have a couple bites of my boyfriend's Cashew Chicken with steamed rice, and it was very delicious and flavorful. \n\nThe speed is what will probably bring me back (to order a different entree) in the future. But Egg Roll King will continue to receive my crab rangoon orders!!","name":"Egg Roll King","address":"1220 S Wells Ave","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89502","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":47,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"OutdoorSeating":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","Alcohol":"u'none'","GoodForKids":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'quiet'","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","Caters":"False","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}","WiFi":"'no'","HasTV":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","BikeParking":"False"},"categories":"Chinese, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"VsR8YRcBepaY2ZFp81yXkw","business_id":"2D8cbzXRcYpxzzx2_Ymx9A","stars_x":3.0,"date":1470165490000,"text":"The portions were huge, prices great and the service was fast.

As such, everything inside is new and clean unlike so many hole-in-the-wall, low-end Chinese joints.  Which made me think, when's the last time a low-end Chinese place opened in Reno or ever?  These places are like old Irish bars.  When's the last time a small Irish bar opened?  Back in the day, there was a lot of discrimination.  You didn't exactly have Irish bankers and Chinese real estate agents.  Lucrative white-collar jobs went to white people of English or German ancestry.  Yes, whites discriminated against whites.  As a result, the minorities (yes, the Irish and Italians were once minorities) found niche markets (besides crime).  Along with other minorities, they often found low-paying, high-risk jobs other white folk did not want (sports, acting, art, writing, selling drugs).  Bars and restaurants happen to be one of the least reliable, least lucrative sources of income, so hence, Chinese and Italian restaurants and Irish bars popped up everywhere.  These days, the Italian restaurants have survived by going upscale while the Chinese just keeping selling to new Chinese immigrants.  Irish bars today are often owned by people of all nationalities (Corrigan's and Foley's are the exception).  \n\nFor those of you who could care less, let's talk about this place now.  \n\nPros:\n\n* I didn't get sick eating here as I usually do in most low-end Chinese, Mexican, and Indian joints.  \n* It's quick, small, efficient, and clean.  \n* Photos of the dishes on the wall help you out.\n* Food portions are generous.  At Panda Express, you get food carton shrinkage.  These guys load up the food so that it almost bursts at the seams.  I ordered two combinations and couldn't finish them.\n* It's local and independent and not corporate.  \n\nCons:\n\n* This isn't PF Chang.  PF Chang is like Chili's and this is more like Del Taco.\n* A bit confusing why the Chef's Special General's Chicken is $6.50 and the Regular Entr\u00c3\u00a9e General's Chicken is $7.95 (obviously probably portion size).\n* The menu is your run-of-the-mill American-Chinese you'll find at almost every single Chinese restaurant in the world, nothing very creative\/authentic unless they have a hidden Chinese menu which I've always considered discriminatory.\n* The breaded chicken is this industry standard, factory made, overly breaded thing with sometimes jerky-like meat that to me borders on inedible.  \n* You can always tell by the vegetables how fresh the food is, and the vegetables are not very fresh.\n\nYou ever wonder why shrimp are getting so big and plump?  They're farm-raised, and you don't even want to know what they're feeding them.  http:\/\/www.businessinsider.com\/disgusting-truths-about-asian-aquaculture-2012-10 \n\nDon't get me wrong, of all the \"hole-in-the-wall\" fast food type, low-end Chinese restaurants, I'd rate this one the best for value and not getting me sick.","name":"Egg Roll King","address":"1220 S Wells Ave","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89502","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":47,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"OutdoorSeating":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","Alcohol":"u'none'","GoodForKids":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'quiet'","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","Caters":"False","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}","WiFi":"'no'","HasTV":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","BikeParking":"False"},"categories":"Chinese, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"czfKqLXWpEskFHrPN-lU3Q","business_id":"2D8cbzXRcYpxzzx2_Ymx9A","stars_x":3.0,"date":1493692607000,"text":"It is what it is, it does not pretend to be anything else.

My first thought was, \"The food here is going to be great.\"  \n\nWhen I'm hungry, I become very indecisive. Of course it's much easier to order from the \"Combination\" part of the menu. I always initially go for Sweet and Sour Pork and for my second entree I ordered the Honey Garlic Chicken. \n\nTheir Sweet and Sour Pork was okay; it was the taste of their sauce. It was different, a bit more sour than sweet. However, I loved their Honey Garlic Chicken. That sweet and garlic glaze really hit the spot. \n\nWith such generous portions for such a great price is something that I will not complain about. If I'm every craving Chinese take out, I'll head straight for Egg Roll King!","name":"Egg Roll King","address":"1220 S Wells Ave","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89502","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":47,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"OutdoorSeating":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","Alcohol":"u'none'","GoodForKids":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'quiet'","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","Caters":"False","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}","WiFi":"'no'","HasTV":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","BikeParking":"False"},"categories":"Chinese, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"1GqTQK0-MUAbWE73aXbfXw","business_id":"2D8cbzXRcYpxzzx2_Ymx9A","stars_x":3.0,"date":1432419065000,"text":"Just wish they deliver.

The broth had a bite too it.  Not too bad, but not what I expected.\n\n     * - Potstickers.  I think they were deep fried instead of pan fried which I would have preferred.\n\n     * - Mongolian Beef.

There were 3 good sized EFY's in the container along with their sauce.  They were tasty, but a bit dry.\n\n     * - Combination House Chow Mein.  This was good!  Full of all the usual suspects, chicken, pork, and shrimp!\n\nI will order in person and wait as there was some confusion as to which online order I had and who I was.

Under $6.00 for a plate that was bursting with food!\nThe gentleman brought out our food in a styrofoam container.

So, I'm not factoring in the take out containers. \nLet's focus on the food. In fact, let's focus on the good stuff first.\nThe schezwan chicken was served blistering hot. OMG was it good. I like most of my food served hot except for most sushi. The schezwan chicken had a nice spice to it and was tasty. The rice was fresh too!\nNow for the sesame chicken and what my dad ordered, the sweet and sour chicken. \nI know this must be a main stay of their business as many of their chicken dishes are deep fried with various sauces on them. So, they must make a lot of their chicken and add the sauce as needed. \nIt shows that it was pre-made. Comparatively speaking, the difference in food temperatures  between the schezwan and sesame chicken was huge. I enjoyed the schezwan chicken but the sesame chicken was served only warm. \nWarm deep fried anything is a no no.

Food here is pricey but the portion somewhat match the price in my opinion. The food here is really good but   some of the food I ordered for my wife was really salty including sauce for the chilaquiles. Went there 2 days in a row.\nFirst time there I ordered the los colorados with flank steak xtra charge of $4.99 and the portion was huge that came with red chilaquiles sauce on crispy tortilla chips top with Mexican sour cream and feta cheese, potatoes top with cheese, grilled purple onions, grilled poblano peppers, grilled jalape\u00c3\u00b1os( spicy ) garnish with stem of cilantro and slices of sweet peppers with a side of black beans. Everything was good but the chilaquiles sauce was a little to salty for my liking but it was still good. The strawberry lemonade was really really good but didn't match the price of $4.99, Also order their mole burrito to-go for the wife and this thing was huge when my wife showed it to me lol, it was almost the size of my thigh yes I said \"THIGH\", filled with ALOT of strip of grilled chicken breast, black beans and cheese covered with mole sauce and sprinkle sesame seed. I was pretty bummed out that it doesn't come with any rice in it. It could easily feed four people, that's how big it was. The chicken was pretty salty and also the mole sauce.\n2nd day I went there I ordered the machaca and taco to-go for the wife. I was too hungry to take a picture of the machaca but it my opinion it did not match the price of $16.99 and wish there was one or two more egg scramble into the machaca. Love the juicy and tenderness of the shredded beef in the machaca but it was pretty bland and I had to add salt and pepper. Scramble with eggs, shredded beef, diced tomatoes, sarano peppers, onions and cilantro with one small scoop of diced potatoes top with cheese then put in a salamander to broil making the cheese melt and turn crispy, which I like, but wish there was more potatoes. Taco which was $11.99 for two matched the price since there was alot of steak meat serve with house made purple tortilla but with all that meat the tortilla ripped when picking it up trying to take a bite. Basically street taco but huge like the size of my forearm huge. Top with diced raw onions, chopped cilantro and guacamole with grilled onions and a side of lime wedges. Love the house made tortilla, always a plus for me, but the steak meat was very salty and almost overpowered the taco. Love the clay plate they serve the food on. Salsa was just ok but good for breakfast. They charge xtra on things you want with your breakfast for additional charge but doesn't stated any prices on the menu including the prices for the lemonade drinks but I hope they soon put it on the menu for the customer's to see.\nWish I could eat here 3 or 4 times a week but it will definitely put a dent in my wallet. Overall I like this place and their location. Will definitely be back to try their other breakfast dish.","name":"Los Chilaquiles Mexican Breakfast","address":"3380 S McCarran Blvd","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89502","stars_y":5.0,"review_count":32,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': True, u'lot': True, u'validated': False}","OutdoorSeating":"False","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","DogsAllowed":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"True","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': None, u'casual': True, u'touristy': None, u'trendy': True, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': None, u'classy': None, u'upscale': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True"},"categories":"Mexican, Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch"},{"review_id":"VrbQd4u9HUK6j1X4Vl-Q8Q","business_id":"DRjFU65k6Iu4tfDZuDkc2A","stars_x":5.0,"date":1640971596000,"text":"This place is unreal!

And it's not ordered fast enough to stay fresh.\n\nThe egg drop soup was probably the best thing. But really nothing more than you would expect from king buffet and seemed condensed as if it had been siting warmed for a while and water had evaporated. But it hits the spot, and good price. The fried rice was actually better than my boyfriend thought it would be, because it's included and still had the eggs, carrots, peas, and red pork (I picked the pork out of mine and added tofu), but it wasn't dry and had good flavor.\n\nThe sesame chicken was awful. Just looking at it, you can tell it looks like fire wood it's so dry. My boyfriend said the breading was soggy which is surprising because it was lacking any sauce and was flavorless and portion was small.\n\nThe ginger beef was much better, it was well sauced, had some flavor, good amount of veggies, not over cooked, but it was pretty chewy due to low quality beef \/ fatty. But the hubby would order again and good price at 10 bucks.\n\nSo skip the fried chicken dishes and only order if you want cheap fast Chinese food delivered.","name":"Egg Roll King","address":"1220 S Wells Ave","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89502","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":47,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"OutdoorSeating":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsReservations":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","Alcohol":"u'none'","GoodForKids":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'quiet'","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","GoodForMeal":"{'dessert': False, 'latenight': False, 'lunch': False, 'dinner': False, 'brunch': False, 'breakfast': False}","Caters":"False","Ambience":"{'touristy': False, 'hipster': False, 'romantic': False, 'divey': False, 'intimate': False, 'trendy': False, 'upscale': False, 'classy': False, 'casual': False}","WiFi":"'no'","HasTV":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","BikeParking":"False"},"categories":"Chinese, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"sF2ZXohuvjjY9-ss2RhFxw","business_id":"DRjFU65k6Iu4tfDZuDkc2A","stars_x":5.0,"date":1640890323000,"text":"I'll keep it short and sweet: \nLovely place; clean, cute decor, beautiful crockery, awesome service. \n\nAt first we were a little put off by the prices, but everything keeps going up and that's just the price to pay for going out.

They come on handmade purple corn tortillas and it was the perfect consistency. You can taste the love. It comes with 3, but these are fully loaded tacos.

Let's start with what was awesome! First off the Mexican coffee and horchata were on point, and we absolutely loved their green salsa. We loved the little appetizers with the soft bread and beans on it. It worked really well, and made the experience in an uphill incline motion... Until we received our sopes, I could smell that the carne Asada was on its way to becoming spoiled.... Okay that's fine... but then it was weird our entire meal we ordered didn't come out all together so we just shared what they did bring us. For whatever reason they couldn't expedite or have it all come out together- it was around 10-12 mins apart so Im thinking maybe they're just trying to work out the kinks and learning how to time food items to come out together? That's what I'm guessing? I ordered the carnitas Chilaquiles but what I received was very over cooked brown scrambled eggs and no carnitas, and over cooked what appeared as a lump of lukewarm white cheese that clumped together with peppers and like 2 potato squares. We reminded them that they forgot the carnitas... so they brought us a bowl 'on the house' which was shimmering in silver color... okay this also was spoiled... the chilaquiles red sauce tasted delicious for sure, but they were lukewarm also clumped with cheese... now onto the black beans (spoiled) I'm not sure what happened with this entire experience- We ordered 3 menu items 2 coffees and 2 horchatas $70 worth of food and drinks. I don't like to be critical, with reviews specially locally owned and just opening...

I believe there were darts and blindfolds involved.. \"pin the tail on the donkey\" type decision making skills. 4 plates were selected. \n\nBut before they arrived, a little something-something arrived - Mexican bread with beans and cheese and I don't remember what else because they were gone in the blink of an eye. \n\nThen little bowls of black beans, and our platters of eggs and tortillas and salsa and veggies and proteins - mine was spare ribs and eggs, DH had chorizo, I can't tell you what the other two enjoyed, because by the time I looked over at their plates, they were clean. \n\nThe service was terrific. The place was really getting busy as we were leaving. I hope they find an incredible following and lots of people enjoy giant plates of yummy breakfast. \n\nPS.. you should go!","name":"Los Chilaquiles Mexican Breakfast","address":"3380 S McCarran Blvd","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89502","stars_y":5.0,"review_count":32,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': True, u'lot': True, u'validated': False}","OutdoorSeating":"False","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","DogsAllowed":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"True","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': None, u'casual': True, u'touristy': None, u'trendy': True, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': None, u'classy': None, u'upscale': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True"},"categories":"Mexican, Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch"},{"review_id":"eWO3cd5Xg9MzUZRhdVBPrw","business_id":"2D8cbzXRcYpxzzx2_Ymx9A","stars_x":5.0,"date":1616630323000,"text":"I've been here many many times.

And as their name suggests, they specialize in Chilaquiles, but they also have traditional Mexican dishes.\nWe happen to come in on the 2nd morning of their opening and they already seemed to be organized and hustling. \nWe were excited to try everything but we contained ourselves to Los Colorados, Divorciados, and coffee brewed Mexican-style (cafe de olla).\nAs expected, our coffee arrived first in a blue enameled steel carafe (something familiar in many Latino households). I love this kind of attention to detail! \nAs we waited for our food the waitress brought over a little appetizer made from tiny bolillos cut in half, topped with a light spread of refried black beans, pico de gallo, queso, and crema. First bite and I'm already loving the flavors.\nNext came our breakfast. My Divorciados dish came with two eggs (I chose over easy) over crispy tortillas topped with green tomatillos sauce on one egg and red ranchera sauce on the other, chorizo, black beans, and homestyle potatoes. Probably one of my best tasting breakfasts I've ever had!! And we just went to Mexico in March and I left craving the amazing breakfast I had there...this breakfast tops it.\nMy husband's Los Colorados included flank steak, chilaquiles in red sauce, two eggs (he chose over easy), saut\u00c3\u00a9ed peppers\/onions, and black beans. Again, amazing! Everything we was full of flavor and love, and the servings were generous.\nAs we were waiting for our check we saw a young couple come in and when the waitress saw them she said, \"You're back today!\" which means on their 2nd day of opening they already had return customers. That says something about a brand new restaurant. I'm predicting that we'll be returning next weekend to try a couple more amazing dishes and I can't wait.","name":"Los Chilaquiles Mexican Breakfast","address":"3380 S McCarran Blvd","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89502","stars_y":5.0,"review_count":32,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': True, u'lot': True, u'validated': False}","OutdoorSeating":"False","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","DogsAllowed":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"True","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': None, u'casual': True, u'touristy': None, u'trendy': True, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': None, u'classy': None, u'upscale': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True"},"categories":"Mexican, Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch"},{"review_id":"WIXFQ5Cw70iOtz-H0uWX0Q","business_id":"DRjFU65k6Iu4tfDZuDkc2A","stars_x":5.0,"date":1640018994000,"text":"Finally!!!

We were promptly greeted and were told the wait would be about 30 minutes.  When we sat they promptly asked for our drink order.  We then were brought some salsa verde and salsa roja and complimentary molletes.  \n\nFor lack of better words; this molletes were fckn delicious.  They use telera bread (which is super soft bollito bread) and just the perfect ratio of black beans, crema mexicana, queso fresco and pico.  \n\nWe started with a queso fundido w\/ chorizo as an appetizer.  For the size it should be a main dish (we couldn't finish it) it is serve with a side of tortilla chips, guac and pico de gallo.  (I would prefer if they serve it with warm tortillas)\n\nFor our main entree we decided on the huevos Divorciados and the Chilaquiles Bandera (added eggs & flank steak)\n\nThe salsas in the huevos divorciados were super tasty and the country potatoes were to die for! They were are mixed with onion and poblano pepper (YUM!!)   The other sides were chorizo and black beans de la olla.  \n\nThe salsa roja on the chilaquiles was just the right amount of heat and the salsa verde was tangy as expected.  The steak was a bit well-done but still very flavorful.\n\nThey also brought complimentary dessert; a small slice of chocoflan! \n\nOverall, the food is delicious and the prices are fair for the quality\/quantity of food they serve.  \n\nP.S.

Running last minute errands on Christmas Eve had me going crazy with hunger! And who can possibly navigate crowds, long lines and crazy traffic when they're hangry? No one! So, lucky me...I was already in S. Reno and anyone who knows me knows I loooovvveee me some chilaquiles, so I headed into Los Chilaquiles!  \n((BTW, the Google had me drive right by it, turn left on to McCarran, and then do a U turn, so ignore that nonsense and just look for their sign in the spot where Mountain Mike's Pizza used to be!))\nThe place was pretty busy inside, with several tables dining in, but to-go was all I had time for today.  Bummer, since that meant I missed the bread appetizers and conchas, since those must be for dine-in only...\nI ordered the Divorciados with over medium eggs, and came back a few minutes later to find my order was already ready already!\nOverall, I'd say the presentation was very nice. The dish had 2 fried tortilla disks with 2 eggs and red & green sauces.  In the middle was a little chunk of pretty overcooked chorizo.  My eggs were a touch past over-medium as well.  There was some nice home-fried potatoes and a small container of black beans and salsas included as well.  It was my choice to order it to-go, but the 2 extremely crunchy tortillas made it very difficult to eat from the take-out container with a flimsy plastic knife & fork. There was a slightly sour, almost off smell and taste to the salsas, so I decided not to risk it and didn't use them.  \nHonestly, for 2 eggs on 2 tortillas, the $15 price tag seems steep to me, and being that I'm E. Sparks, I don't usually cross town for just 1 dish.  There is certainly more to the menu than I even had time to look at, and dining in seems to be the way to go for extra meal perks, so I hope the opportunity comes around for me to return and try something else.","name":"Los Chilaquiles Mexican Breakfast","address":"3380 S McCarran Blvd","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89502","stars_y":5.0,"review_count":32,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': True, u'lot': True, u'validated': False}","OutdoorSeating":"False","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","DogsAllowed":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"True","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': None, u'casual': True, u'touristy': None, u'trendy': True, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': None, u'classy': None, u'upscale': False}","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True"},"categories":"Mexican, Restaurants, Breakfast & Brunch"},{"review_id":"-JxTjw52rnFzWo0v2iHQ4A","business_id":"3MgLckfXtG00QOyMpP4S-A","stars_x":5.0,"date":1636338759000,"text":"Friday and Saturday night good times, delicious small bites to share with good friends.

We ordered a pineapple margarita, it said it was made with fresh pineapple juice. When I tasted it, it tasted like straight simple syrup with a very artificial pineapple taste. I couldn't drink it. My husband ordered a mezcal drink that was just ok. When the waiter came I let him know my drink was terrible and that's when he told me they don't use fresh pineapple juice. So instead we ordered two beers and two shots. Our Queso  cheese dip was ok. I ordered Al pastor tacos and my husband ordered the TACOS DE AGUACATE which are supposed to be crispy corn tortillas with avocado and cheese inside. I received my very small tacos that were ok but my husband received the cactus tacos. The waiter apologized and took the cactus tacos back and brought another plate to my husband that had two cold tortillas with avocado and tomato on top. We asked him what it was and explained he couldn't get the kitchen to make what was on the menu. Ok WTF. He then asked if there was anything else on the menu we wanted. By then I was done eating and my husband still hadn't. So we ordered some chili Colorado. It came and was just ok but we needed to go after all this time trying to get our food so we asked for a to go box. While waiting for a to go box the waiter brought another margarita even know I ordered a beer in place of it. I tried it and again it was terrible so I didn't drink it. The waiter was really nice and apologized again. He seemed frustrated with the kitchen staff as I was too. Well we got our bill....$100. We were charged for my husband's plate that he never received and also the margarita. Wow just wow. We have never experienced such terrible food\/service. We still tipped our waiter $20. $120 for an hour of trying to just get what was on the menu that the cooks in the kitchen would not make. The owner of this business really needs to address these issues. It's such a nice location but I don't see it lasting with service like this. Apparently we are not the first people to have these issues. Our waiter told use that people are complaining about the drinks not being made properly and the food not being prepared with the ingredients listed on the menu. We will never go back and will not suggest this place to anyone.","name":"Mari Chuy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tequileria - Rancharrah","address":"7500 Rancharrah Pkwy, Ste 100","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89511","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":25,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': False, u'lot': True, u'validated': False}","DogsAllowed":"True","BusinessAcceptsBitcoin":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","WiFi":"u'no'","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","RestaurantsReservations":"True","DriveThru":"False","RestaurantsTableService":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","CoatCheck":"False","Smoking":"u'no'","HasTV":"True","ByAppointmentOnly":"False","HappyHour":"False","WheelchairAccessible":"True","BikeParking":"True","Ambience":"{u'divey': False, u'hipster': None, u'casual': None, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': None, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': None, u'classy': None, u'upscale': None}","Caters":"True","Music":"{u'dj': None, u'live': False, u'jukebox': None, u'video': False, u'background_music': False, u'karaoke': None, u'no_music': False}","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'"},"categories":"Restaurants, Cocktail Bars, Bars, Mexican, Tapas Bars, Nightlife"},{"review_id":"BhqFQ7Tr25Ur8BTZclyezw","business_id":"3MgLckfXtG00QOyMpP4S-A","stars_x":5.0,"date":1637475627000,"text":"Chuy, Javier, and Kristin are doing it right!

None of the servers or kitchen staff were wearing masks despite the state mandate for indoor mask requirements. We did not have a reservation but half the tables and almost the whole bar were empty so it seemed like an easy bet. We had to wait another 10 minutes and the host asked us if the bar would be fine. Another 5 min go by before we were waited on. We decided just to order food and not get drinks, the wait staff and the kitchen looked overwhelmed with the few guest that were there. Our food came about 20 min later and it was ok but nothing to write home about. Same tortillas I buy at the store (I could see them in the kitchen). The chicken in my mole enchiladas was kinda bland and only saved by the sauce. The same chicken was in the tacos, which were the smallest street tacos I've ever seen. \nI hope they up their game here because it could be a really good place but the service was really lacking and the food not as good as many taquerias in town.","name":"Mari Chuy\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Tequileria - Rancharrah","address":"7500 Rancharrah Pkwy, Ste 100","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89511","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":25,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': False, u'lot': True, u'validated': False}","DogsAllowed":"True","BusinessAcceptsBitcoin":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","OutdoorSeating":"True","WiFi":"u'no'","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","RestaurantsReservations":"True","DriveThru":"False","RestaurantsTableService":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","CoatCheck":"False","Smoking":"u'no'","HasTV":"True","ByAppointmentOnly":"False","HappyHour":"False","WheelchairAccessible":"True","BikeParking":"True","Ambience":"{u'divey': False, u'hipster': None, u'casual': None, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': None, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': None, u'classy': None, u'upscale': None}","Caters":"True","Music":"{u'dj': None, u'live': False, u'jukebox': None, u'video': False, u'background_music': False, u'karaoke': None, u'no_music': False}","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'"},"categories":"Restaurants, Cocktail Bars, Bars, Mexican, Tapas Bars, Nightlife"},{"review_id":"Chc7R3ezVBbePRxnJnJ2mg","business_id":"3MgLckfXtG00QOyMpP4S-A","stars_x":2.0,"date":1634961891000,"text":"I really wanted to give this place 4 stars because the location is nice, the place is beautiful and they have a good concept; however, the execution needs a lot of improvement.\n\nWe visited this place 3 times. The 1st time was during their soft opening and we were really satisfied with the food and drinks.  A few of the items on the menu weren't available and it was understandable since it was just the soft opening.  We order the queso fundido, chile colorado and albondigas.  We also had drinks and they were really good as well.  \n\nThe 2nd time we ordered items from the appetizers selection, the taquitos, ceviche de atun and the salsas.  The taquitos were good, ceviche lack flavor but was an easy fix with a bit salt and lime, the salsas were alright but a very small portion.\n\nThe 3rd time was very disappointing.  We order the Guacamole de la Casa (which is supposed to be topped with Bacon Jalape\u00c3\u00b1o).  The hostess brought us a guacamole that did not scream 'Guacamole de La Casa' and it did not had bacon jalape\u00c3\u00b1o.  I asked her and she said she was fairly new and didnt know what it came it but that she would ask a server.\n\nI heard when she asked Marcos (who I am assuming is the manager) about the bacon.  He looked at our guacamole and he asked her 'ohh you brought them that one?!' Which i am assuming is the one that they use to top taquitos and enchiladas.  So instead of exchanging it he just had her bring us some bacon on the side.  I then asked the server that I think they brought us the wrong guacamole and that i didn't wanna pay $12 for a guacamole that was made in a blender.  He told me that they usually  make the guacamole table side but that they were too busy that night and that's the guacamole they were serving.  WTF!!\n(Please see pics)\nNeeedless to say I don't think I would be giving them a 4th chance any time soon.

After fifteen minutes our order was finally taken.  Mediocre molcajete with dry chicken and beef, tiny shrimp. Peppers were undercooked.  Sauce unappealing.  Only 3 small tortillas.  Chile relleno was dried out at the tip of the pepper, little cheese stuffing it.  A folded piece of egg (like an omelet) was lain on top of the pepper, as opposed to dredged and surrounding it.  My friend ordered steak tacos but had to ask the server to box them up to go, because it took too long for them to come for him to be able to eat them.  He had 45 minutes at the restaurant.  Best dish by far was the nachos which I would order again.  Great presentation, large portion, a nice mix of flavors.  And if I had to return to this restaurant, I would not risk ordering anything else because 1 out of 4 is a terrible record.  Forgot to mention I tried to order a cocktail but was told that their signature cocktails were not available because the bartender was not present.  So I ordered a house margarita which was served in a lowball glass, and didn't have fresh lime or distinct tequila flavors.  To top it off, at the end of the meal our server didn't return to our table.  She was sitting at a table elsewhere in the restaurant, on her phone.  In front of her there was a tray with silverware, which I suppose was an effort to prepare settings, but she was preoccupied.

They had ripe avocados for $1.39 and nice looking tomatoes for $1.58 a lbs. So the prices were not bad. Also, the Pastor de puerco is $3.99\/lbs so again great price. We decided to try the chicken mix also for the same price. \n\nAs we were leaving, I noticed they had a little caf\u00c3\u00a9 inside. They serve traditional Mexican foods, and the prices are good. We ordered three tacos Carne Asada And one taco chili Verde. They were $1.59 each. When they arrive, the chili Verde was red and the lady told me in Spanish that they didn't have verde only rojo... I decided what the heck it looks really good.\n\nThe first thing you see about the tacos, if you look at the picture, tons of meat. There's So much meat, it covers the whole tortilla. We were able to split the double tortillas that were given, and make two tacos Adam it's Taco. So we actually had 8 tacos lol. Yeah, not much meat. The flavors were amazing, flavorful and fresh. There is also an option for homemade or handmade tortillas, that cost a dollar extra though so we opted for the traditional factory tortillas. There is also a salsa bar, or you can get salsa both red and green, limes, cilantro, limes and fresh cut onions. All in all very nice. This is For me, one of the best places to go now. We usually get our Carnitas and to chicharons here for taco night. However the Carnitas were sold out and the chechrons were really dark and seemed overcooked. \n\nReally an inexpensive place to get all you need for making the authentic tacos at home as well as the caf\u00c3\u00a9 provide some really authentic Mexican food At a really inexpensive price.","name":"Carniceria Samber","address":"2360 Oddie Blvd","city":"Sparks","state":"NV","postal_code":"89431","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":33,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","DogsAllowed":"False","Caters":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsTableService":"True","BusinessAcceptsBitcoin":"False","HasTV":"True","OutdoorSeating":"False","Alcohol":"u'beer_and_wine'","WheelchairAccessible":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"False"},"categories":"Food, Restaurants, Butcher, Specialty Food, Mexican, Desserts, Meat Shops, Grocery"},{"review_id":"GRENA5A82gxriCEBYQ_gpg","business_id":"VCwxG-i9zG7u3ahqBoT1wA","stars_x":5.0,"date":1501640372000,"text":"First time to the place and it was like being back in Mexico.

One wall is a red brick and the other is covered with colorful art. Many TVs throughout. Has a Good selection of beers. Wine is limited but the white blend was decent. Our server was attentive and very sweet. Also they have a couple games for the kiddos to play which my son enjoyed. We were able to play uno after we ate our meal and finish our drinks;)\n\nWe Started with the beet salad! It was super good. More goat cheese then I've personally ever seen on a salad before in my life! No complaints there.\n\nNext came the tachos with steak. Which are nachos but with tater tots in place of chips. I think they were good, but they definitely needed hot sauce, just our personal preference. There was an additional up charge for the steak which is fine and expected but there just wasn't much of it?? Just the smallest sprinkling of it.\n\nThen we tried the jambalaya balls. They were large with a thick bread coating. Mostly seemed to be filled with dirty rice. Not bad, just not for me. \n\nAlso tried the Fish and chips. The fries were perfect. The fish was very greasy, especially on the inside. Each bite seemed filled with oil and unfortunately with the vinegar and tartar they seemed fairly bland. \n\nFor dessert we got the churro bites. These were a miss for me. Overly tough and dry, not just on the outside but all throughout. No soft chewy center... however my son still gobbled them up.

I have been so stoked about this place since I first saw the alcohol permit posted and have been patiently waiting for them to open. I heard they were doing a soft opening this week so I knew I had to jump on the chance.\n\nFirst off, the ambiance is such a vibe! They left a lot of the Under The Rose layout and added murals, neon signs, bright and modern furniture and some really nice touches. It's clear a lot of thought went into the design. \n\nThe staff is very kind--we talked to our hostess at length and she was very helpful. The owner actually sat down with us and asked how we liked the food and his plans for the future. \n\nNow the beer: it was all so incredible! I got a flight so I could try multiple beers and was not disappointed by any. Im blanking on the name now, but they have a spicy pineapple one that is AMAZING! They already have a huge selection and it sounds like they have more to come. \n\nAs for the food, we only tried two things but both were SO good. The sliders are literally perfect--great proportions on the meat and the flavor is incredible. The fries are good too. We also got the totchos and those were good, though I feel like could use more sauce and more cheese (but that's just my opinion). The owner was telling us that the chef is from the South so there's definitely a southern influence on the menu and all sound bomb.\n\nI'm so excited Wonder is finally open--I can't wait to frequent this spot!!","name":"Wonder Aleworks","address":"1041 S Virginia St","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89502","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":47,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"GoodForKids":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","OutdoorSeating":"True","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"None","WheelchairAccessible":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': True, u'lot': False, u'validated': False}"},"categories":"Food, Restaurants, Bars, Breakfast & Brunch, Nightlife, Wine Bars, Cocktail Bars, Brewpubs, Breweries"},{"review_id":"UFKUtZ8NBXqhxapFKRs_NA","business_id":"VCwxG-i9zG7u3ahqBoT1wA","stars_x":4.0,"date":1374425848000,"text":"I have not tried the hot food so I will review the meat department.

Wonder Ale Works occupies the spot of the former Under the Rose, and have totally revitalized this fantastic spot. Some things seem familiar, others are wholly new. But all told, it coalesces to form an excellent drinking and dining experience.\n\nHaving visited a few times, it is very clear that the beer selection changes quite frequently. And talking to a few of the staff, it seems that given their smaller setup their goal at present is to make smaller batches of beers and rotate one or two in and out on an almost weekly basis, which certainly keeps things interesting. So while it means you may not see any flagships for the time being, the upshot is that it gives you all the more opportunity to try a wide range of types and styles.  So far I've tried such things as an Australian Pilsner that was a real eye-opener, an Imperial White Ale that really blew me away, and the Golden Rooster, an remarkably good and coffee-rich Blonde Stout, which when you get a shot of \"Rooster Booster\", a shot of coffee rum, really skyrockets the flavor AND the ABV. For sure worth a try. Beyond the beer, there is a full bar, with several signature house cocktails.\n\nAs for food, I must say they likewise hit all the right notes. The emphasis on the menu seems to be lots of sharable dishes, with some items being more familiar bumped-up bar fare and other creative house specialties available. They make a very nice Caesar wedge salad, for one. Their mozzarella sticks were exceptional, as well. But what they really hit it out of the park are the Shrimp and Grits. Holy cow, these are amazing! If you try one entr\u00c3\u00a9e, make it this. And make sure to come hungry if you do, as this dish fills you right up.\n\nPrices here are very decent across the board, with a few items on the menu being a tad pricier, but the quality you get is outstanding. If possible, try to swing down during happy hour, where specials on food abound. Service has been, with only a few hiccups, very good indeed, with one bartender, \"Cass\" I believe her name was, being exceptionally friendly, attentive to all the customers, and having lots of great beer and food suggestions! The overall atmosphere fees much more like a sit-down restaurant than a typical brewery-pub, with bright, colorful d\u00c3\u00a9cor, plenty of table and bar space, and a small front patio with a fire pit. Nice to see older buildings like this finding new life as Midtown continues to grow and change. Parking is found either in the lot around the corner, or street spaces in the surrounding blocks.\n\nAll in all, this is another wonderful addition to the Reno beer scene. I will definitely be stopping back again real soon, wondering what is on tap next.\n\nCheers, guys!","name":"Wonder Aleworks","address":"1041 S Virginia St","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89502","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":47,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"GoodForKids":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","OutdoorSeating":"True","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"None","WheelchairAccessible":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': True, u'lot': False, u'validated': False}"},"categories":"Food, Restaurants, Bars, Breakfast & Brunch, Nightlife, Wine Bars, Cocktail Bars, Brewpubs, Breweries"},{"review_id":"9bwasOOhxZ1tR3nq61DDnQ","business_id":"YdRR0gjg20QSsPfsT1mKXQ","stars_x":4.0,"date":1640303044000,"text":"Pretty solid beers (some hits, some misses), good looking menu, nice hang. \n\nI accidentally found this place and I'm happy I did.","name":"Wonder Aleworks","address":"1041 S Virginia St","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89502","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":47,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"GoodForKids":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","OutdoorSeating":"True","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"None","WheelchairAccessible":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': True, u'lot': False, u'validated': False}"},"categories":"Food, Restaurants, Bars, Breakfast & Brunch, Nightlife, Wine Bars, Cocktail Bars, Brewpubs, Breweries"},{"review_id":"hyN3L-j9U5YzT8WqAzShUw","business_id":"tYTcXfgRbAQMCAom2UlDZw","stars_x":5.0,"date":1641680328000,"text":"This place was a treat!

I ordered 2 long rolls, Umi roll and a cotton candy baked roll. The place was empty when I came to pick up my order. The hostess was standing at the back end of the restaurant and slowly came over to ask if I was eating in or picking up. I let her know I was picking up an order. It wasn't ready so I sat and waited. A couple minutes later she came back with my order and the check. $25+ tip for two rolls, yikes. I was really hoping the rolls were worth the price and the hype. Unfortunately I didn't love it. The Umi roll was too heavy on the Mayo sauce and the cotton candy roll didn't look appetizing with the brown avocado in it. Taste was just ok.

This was not it. I'm sure many people like the food and that's great. It has 5 stars on Yelp but not for authenticity. I don't expect truly authentic Japanese food but if you're going to call yourself a Japanese restaurant then at least try to mimic the Japanese emphasis on taste AND presentation. The wasabi and ginger dish looked like someone's leftovers. A Japanese chef would never serve wasabi scraped on to the edge of the dish or the ginger flayed out all over. I ordered sashimi which was thick cut and fresh. I was hopeful. Then the salmon teriyaki came and it was so over cooked (not to mention served on bell peppers with very little teriyaki sauce). My sons chicken Katsu was also dry. The bento came with gyoza and tempura. There was no sauce for either and only a drizzle of tonkatsu sauce on the Katsu. The sauce in the bento, which I assumed was for the salad, was just ok.  The miso soup had too much miso paste and was very very salty. At least there was some tofu in the soup. Sakana serves diluted miso soup with nothing in it. I didn't order sushi because I prefer traditional rolls and there weren't any. I don't care for imitation crab or cream cheese in my sushi so that's on me. The first ingredient in their 3 poke dishes was also shredded crab. No crab goes in poke. Btw, I'm half Japanese and my mom owned a Japanese restaurant in Vegas. I worked there for 7 years.

The rating is based on the full package of value to quality to experience, etc.  It is still early in their opening so I am sure they have some kinks to work out.  We tried the caprese salad, tacos and the chicken and waffle along with a few of their beers on tap.\n\nThe food had some mixed results.  The taco trio was excellent.  They had great flavor, were presented well and really checked all the boxes.  That was the best part of the meal.  The chicken and waffle was good but two small pieces of chicken and a single thin waffle as a \"large sharable\" was a bit of a let down.  While it tasted good, there was nothing exceptional about the item and for $18, you can definitely get a much larger serving of the same item at a lot of different places in town, likely something to skip next time for me.  The caprese salad was good and had some little crunchy salt bits on it.  However, the tomatoes weren't the nicest looking and the bed of spinach under it could have used some dressing if it was meant to be eaten. \n\nThe beers were good, the pineapple-pepper one was the best of the three tried for the night. Great flavor and creative.  The beer pricing seems pretty fair so that was a positive.  Service was good as well. Very friendly and attentive staff. \n\nI didn't dislike my night there but I wasn't blown away either.  The biggest drawback for the spot is the value for what you get.  While the food and beer may taste good, you are definitely spending more money for the same items you can get elsewhere.  To me, this is likely more of a location to grab a beer and a snack and then make your way off somewhere to get a dinner. The menu does look fun so I do imagine we will be back at some point to try something else.","name":"Wonder Aleworks","address":"1041 S Virginia St","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89502","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":47,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"GoodForKids":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'average'","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","OutdoorSeating":"True","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"None","WheelchairAccessible":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': True, u'lot': False, u'validated': False}"},"categories":"Food, Restaurants, Bars, Breakfast & Brunch, Nightlife, Wine Bars, Cocktail Bars, Brewpubs, Breweries"},{"review_id":"HXwpeLB_g4D4-Pbj5msDgg","business_id":"eUEsv7KzTKyc17CHmPtKxw","stars_x":1.0,"date":1635025771000,"text":"First time we went here it was meh.

Disclaimer: I used to live in Orange County and go back often so I know good Korean food. My dad and I ordered the calamari, japchae, pork katsu, and pork bulgogi.  Katsu is a thin, breaded cutlet. The breading is light and crispy. Koko's katsu was a pork chop that was not tenderized and flattened and the breading was hard and Western style (it had more in common with shake n bake than katsu). The sauce tasted like it was store bought. The calamari had a thick breading but was tender. The tempura sauce was too heavy on soy and it overpowered the squid flavor. When I ordered the pork bulgogi I thought it would be dwaeji bulgogi but their bulgogi tasted okay. It lacked spice and that nice char that is part of Korean barbeque. I've never had bad japchae before Koko's and I did not realize that was a dish that could be messed up. The noodles were hard, there was no flavor, and I think the entire order had two pieces of black fungus and one bite of red bell pepper. Japchae is supposed to have deliciously almost chewy noodles (think less chewy than boba but more so than pasta). Japchae noodles are made with sweet potato starch. The banchan included fishy fish cakes (sub-par at best), potato salad (less sweet than normal Asian potato salad but not terrible), kimchi (mehh), cucumber kimchi (not crunchy and just sad), and bean sprouts (no flavor).\nThe second star is because the restaurant is new and the people were nice but I would not come back.

Please take my feedback with a grain of salt (which you'll be pleased to know is not an ingredient they overuse here).\n\nI'll begin by stating that it's Yelp that brought us here. I hadn't heard any word of this place previously. The location is unassuming, and you're more likely to end up at Dominoes than here if you aren't paying attention.\n\nThe interior is cute and intimate, but not romantic. This is an ideal lunch spot. It's on the slower side now, but I expect that to change over time. There aren't even enough Korean restaurants in Reno from which to gauge the cuisine, in my opinion.\n\nThe menu is very accessible, which is a description that comes with a few noticeable caveats -- don't order anything spicy with the expectation that it will be spicy. I'd really like to see the term \"spicy\" live up to its definition in this city. You can't go to any Asian restaurant and have actual spicy food served. The spicy chicken here is sweeter than the kimchi. That's why I'm not prepared to raise my stars. There was also a significant amount of gristle in one bit of my beef bulgogi, as well as in one bite of the chicken. I understand that can sometimes be part of the rustic experience, but having to awkwardly spit a bit of food into a napkin because I can't chew it bugs me.\n\nThe tea was actually one of the highlights for me. Their jasmine tea is a bargain at $5 for two, and it's loose leaf! The fragrance alone transported me to another continent.\n\nService was efficient enough, but the waiter did incorrectly describe the spicy chicken as breaded (we couldn't tell from the tiny menu picture), and it is most certainly not.\n\nThe soup served was daikon and soybean in a black pepper broth. It was a perfect start to things! We started with their tempura shrimp appetizer. I'd definitely order it again. It was fairly priced at $6.50 for six pieces, and the dipping sauce was good.\n\nThe temperature contrast of all the food was the most interesting part of the experience. The northern hemisphere of my box were the hot items, and the southern hemisphere were all the cold items.\n\nWe'll be back to support this local restaurant as they make small adjustments to refine and standardize their menu.","name":"Koko\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Korean Kitchen","address":"1655 Robb Dr, Ste 2","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89523","stars_y":4.5,"review_count":26,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': None, u'casual': None, u'touristy': None, u'trendy': None, u'intimate': None, u'romantic': None, u'classy': True, u'upscale': False}","OutdoorSeating":"False","RestaurantsDelivery":"None","RestaurantsTableService":"True","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': None, u'lot': None, u'validated': False}","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True"},"categories":"Asian Fusion, Korean, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"Lx98owiUrijb-x03gBkT4Q","business_id":"eUEsv7KzTKyc17CHmPtKxw","stars_x":4.0,"date":1637704140000,"text":"They said they had only been open for a month.

We also got a bowl of the soup of the day: a broth with tofu and peppery flavor.\n\nOverall I was quite impressed! The meats were tender and very flavorful.

That is the name of the store. :)\n\nI'm sure any of us could have come up with something a bit more interesting than that, but I suppose you have to be straight forward with people in northern Nevada. Not too many stores in that area with the things that this one sells or at least I never found one.\n\nFor a long time it was hard finding many Asian foods, cooking items, etc in Tahoe and so we had to find other places to get what we needed. Often times we had to wait until a trip to San Francisco to pick up things that we needed. There was a particular store, a Hawaiian store that had a lot of the things we loved to eat, but after moving twice, they ended up closing shop. That forced us to look elsewhere. \n\nAfter many searches, I found this place in Sparks and since we made weekly trips to Reno it was no issue going there. I couldn't find anything other than a name. So that meant taking a drive there to find out for ourselves what they had. It turned out being a VERY worthwhile trip. The store was of a decent size. They sold the rice we liked, they had cuttlefish (which I LOVE), haw flakes, various sauces and spices we cooked with, lup cheong, saimin, manapua (and other buns) and they even had Aloha Shoyu!!! Which had become a rare find in those parts. They also had all the other fare of the Pacific Islands and the region.\n\nIf you were looking for fresh fish, they had that as well as fresh veggies, but given the fact they were hours away from the Pacific Ocean, I wasn't too sure about the freshness, but it all looked good though.\n\nIf you wanted something hot to eat, well then you're in luck. They make a variety of foods for take out. Their sesame chicken was favorite of mine. Add some white rice and mmmmmm... I was set :)\n\n\nIt was a such a great find and we shopped there all the time. I give it 5 stars because it made our lives in Tahoe even that much better. We had gone without those things for a few years and they were all very missed.","name":"Asia Market","address":"2152 Prater Way","city":"Sparks","state":"NV","postal_code":"89431","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":28,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"1","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Alcohol":"'none'","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': True, u'street': False, u'lot': True, u'validated': False}"},"categories":"Chinese, Grocery, International Grocery, Imported Food, Specialty Food, Food, Restaurants, Ethnic Food"},{"review_id":"mV2rRF9C7j8iln5GK82BhQ","business_id":"_PonI4BbL5-VxGzwqJKzeQ","stars_x":5.0,"date":1380748931000,"text":"We stopped here while visiting Sparks and was very impressed with this store, especially with the selection of fresh fish.

It's definitely 4.5 in my book.  The tiramisu was tasty: it was light and had a nice coffee flavor: probably my favorite of the three.  It was so deliciously light!  \n\nThe meatball sub was also tasty, albeit not blow me away good.  Would I prefer it to the type of sandwich shop I get at a sandwich shop?  Absolutely!  It absolutely blows Subway out of the water.  I'd personally prefer a bit more flavor: maybe an arrabiata, or some more herbs, or maybe have my meatballs a bit more browned or something.  I wanted the seasoning to be more aggressive, in one way or another.\n\nThe eggplant parmesan was just okay.  I honestly found it a bit off.  I make eggplant parmesan, and while this was an okay rendition, I feel like I could make better.  (That being said, it would take me 2 hours and I'd have to make 8 servings.)  But again I wanted more seasoning, and while it was certainly good I think it would've been better if the eggplant were just a little bit more cooked (though it was still perfectly fine)\n\nThis is very much a neighborhood deli in what maybe isn't quite a neighborhood, and that makes this a bit weird.  If I were in a small town and this was in my local neighborhood, I'd be quite happy.  Considering it's not that far from midtown and downtown, where there are a lot of other food options all over the map, the vibe feels a bit weird.  \n\nIt's a deli that almost counts as a restaurant based on its offerings.  If you think of it like a neighborhood deli, it's fantastic, albeit a bit more expensive and maybe mislocated.  If you think of it as a restaurant and compare it to the best Italian restaurants in Reno, it doesn't quite measure up, albeit it's definitely cheaper.

The Pork sliders that I ordered were 95% fat which was too much for me so I passed those on to my wife and I settled on eating the Tavern fries. The Tavern fries were ok but nothing to write home about. I also tried the coleslaw. I do not know what kind of coleslaw recipe that was but it was awful. It had a chemical taste to it like someone sprayed cleaner in it. Obviously that went to waste. \nWhile waiting for our food to come out, there was loud cursing coming from the kitchen.

For 8 wings, 2 small sliders w\/coleslaw, a serving of Tavern Fries and 2 cokes came to $50. \nIt pains me to have to leave a review such as this but it was truly a terrible experience. \nOn a side not, it is very difficult to get into this building if you are in a wheelchair. \nI sincerely hope for the sake of your business that you are able to do better.","name":"Huntsman Brewing","address":"124 Wonder St","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89502","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":44,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"WheelchairAccessible":"True","ByAppointmentOnly":"False","OutdoorSeating":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","Smoking":"u'no'","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': None, u'lot': None, u'validated': False}"},"categories":"Pizza, Chicken Wings, Food, Brewpubs, Nightlife, Beer Gardens, Pubs, Bars, Breweries, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"Bb1uvVWYHioPuSVyNt63LA","business_id":"_PonI4BbL5-VxGzwqJKzeQ","stars_x":5.0,"date":1578937241000,"text":"My favorite Asian store in the Sparks\/Reno area.

Greeted promptly, and given menus, and asked for drink order.  I would say service initially was good, but it was fairly obvious the waitress wasn't very experienced.  Menu is okay - I was expecting more, probably because of my experience with the previous restaurant, Silver Peak.  We ordered fish and chips and the bison burger, along with an apricot beer and a glass of pinot.  The burger was extremely dry, there was nothing on it as far as condiments go.  Too much bread to meat ratio.  The fries - I had high hopes, they looked good, if a bit greasy, but they weren't done.  They weren't crispy, they were raw in the middle.   The final straw if you will, was when we got our bill - I didn't get to see a copy of the bill, she just came with a machine and then asked me to read my card number including the expiration date in the middle of a restaurant with customers at lunchtime.    I found that very unprofessional and sketchy - anyone could have overheard and written it down.  She said she couldn't see the numbers and didn't have her glasses (really?)

What has Reno truly been missing?  A great Italian deli with quick high quality meals.  Don't breathe on anyone for a few days after eating at this amazing authentic Italian deli.  We recently had the Misto Salad, Meatballs, Lasagna, Eggplant Parmigiana.  \n\nMy wife and I both ordered the Misto Salad.  The Misto salad had, like the name denotes, a mix of tantalizing roasted vegetables, fresh light angel hair pasta salad, simply satisfying white bean salad, and a small green salad full of little surprises like olives, red onions and a light house Italian dressing.  \n\nA few days before tonight's visit I ordered the eggplant parmigiana piled high with flavorful homemade marinara and high quality mozzarella and parmigiana.  The eggplant is roasted to perfection not fried like so many others.  \n\nBack to tonight, my daughter ordered a huge slice, of \"like momma made\" lasagna.  The highest quality tomato sauce, mozzarella, b\u00c3\u00a9chamel rather than ricotta, just the right amount of meat.  She ate everything on her plate and gave it a thumbs up to take one home from the case for our son. I had a bite and.  I make a great lasagna and this was worth the trip.  \n\nBoth of my visits I ordered meatballs on the side and can't wait to come back and eat more.  Light, let the meatballs do all the speaking for themselves, smothered in homemade sauce and a sprinkle of parmigiana.  They are tender, juicy, not overly seasoned or overly filled with breadcrumbs.  The prefect balance of love and experience go into all of the dishes.  \n\nI am coming back soon to try the Porchetta sandwich ASAP!  \n\nThank you for opening a quick high quality Italian deli here in Reno.  \n\nIf you want to bring the family for an early dinner get there before 6.  It is worth rushing over with the family, or just drive by on your way home and take it with you.  It is quick and ready to go as soon as you get up to the deli case.  \n\nThe owner brought out a small Caprese salad with our Misto salad I forgot to mention.  Lightly drizzled with olive oil, fresh basil.  He also brought out a thick balsamic vinegar strait from Modena, with salt and pepper.  \n\nI feel extremely welcome every time I visit.

While running family errands, we stopped at a gas station\/convenience store in Sparks. Tucked in the back corner is a small kitchen, complete with a flat-top grill and deep fryer. I've heard the place previously served pizza; before that, burgers with a drive-thru window. It's now home to Nevada Taco Grill, a no frills taqueria serving up the goods in a tiny space with seating for perhaps 10, assuming they're well-acquainted. My trio ordered a few items, and found a spot to sit and dine amongst folks waiting on take-out.\n\nThe two person operation was cranking out food in short order, and we soon settled into our unplanned feast. Somewhat ironically, the tacos were actually the least successful items. Curious about the difference between the \"street\" vs \"regular\" tacos, we tried a couple of each ($1.99 and $2.99, respectively). Choice of meats included shredded chicken or beef, grilled chicken, carne asada, carnitas, and adobada, and they also have specials during the week that include hard-shell, house-fried tortillas.\n\nThe street variety were the typical pair of 3\" corn tortillas--topped with meat, diced onion, and fresh cilantro--while the regulars were 6\" single tortillas with the same ingredients, plus fresh pico de gallo. The pork carnitas and adobada were a bit on the crunchy side from being tossed on the grill, but they still tasted good. Beef asada was better, though a tad chewy. They were also a little light on the meat, compared to other tacos around town.\n\nA combo plate of three shredded beef, rolled tacos were served with melted cheese on top, guacamole, and sides of rice and beans ($7.25). The taquitos were crunchy with good masa flavor--filled with plenty of seasoned meat--and much better than their unfried cousins. The rice was fair, frijoles refritos quite good, but the guacamole was a blended, runny sauce. Not bad, just not the chunky stuff I prefer.\n\nGiven a choice between shredded or grilled chicken on my mother's torta ($5.75), we went grilled. The small chunks of meat were actually tender and reasonably moist, accompanied by bell pepper, onion, tomato, and lettuce on a soft, perfectly lovely Mexican roll. The kind of soft that almost falls apart when you bite in. We all agreed it was a damn fine sandwich.\n\nAlways on the hunt for a decent chile relleno--yet always with low expectations--I went ahead and got the relleno and cheese enchilada combo plate ($8.75). The enchilada was average, but the stuffed pepper was easily my favorite item of the meal. The large poblano was meaty--not overcooked--with a nice bit of kick. Stuffed with a ton of melty cheese and topped with a fresh and flavorful, just-shy-of-chunky red enchilada sauce, every bite made me sad to see it disappear. Surprisingly, this gas station chile relleno is among my top 5 from the past few years.\n\nMy wife just can't not order nachos ($9.50), and I'm glad she did. Topped with a ton of carne asada, refried beans, pico de gallo, sour cream, guacamole, and both melted and shredded cheese sprinkles, the thin, crispy chips did a respectable job with their burden. The chips themselves were excellent, and the bounty of well-seasoned meat and beans more-or-less made the cheese irrelevant. It was even good as leftovers the next day.","name":"Nevada Taco Grill","address":"2995 Vista Blvd","city":"Sparks","state":"NV","postal_code":"89434","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":28,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': None, u'lot': None, u'validated': None}","RestaurantsDelivery":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","Ambience":"{u'divey': None, u'hipster': None, u'casual': True, u'touristy': False, u'trendy': False, u'intimate': False, u'romantic': False, u'classy': None, u'upscale': False}"},"categories":"Mexican, Tacos, Restaurants, Fast Food, Food Stands"},{"review_id":"3vAnTL3NkRFoUydxMWgtfA","business_id":"weEcI_e-OC7UgODWPRvavw","stars_x":4.0,"date":1624417198000,"text":"So Paolos Deli is owned by the former owner of La Familia Italian Restaurant in Down Town Reno.

I was always so-so on silver peak's beer and food, but the wonder street location was such a neat spot I was really hoping something good would go in there. I'm glad to see Huntsman brought new life into the space! \n\nFor the beer: I got a flight of ales, IPA's, etc. and I loved everything I tried. The pumpkin one was way better than I expected it to be, as was the milkshake one. I wish I could remember the names but I really did like all of them. \n\nFor food: we got the pork belly jalape\u00c3\u00b1os for an appetizer and wings for the entr\u00c3\u00a9e. I felt like the pork belly was perfect but the jalape\u00c3\u00b1os themselves were lack luster--they were still crunchy\/raw and not very warm so maybe a few more minutes in the oven would have helped. I ended up getting the orange ginger wings and the regular wings, which both were good. I was confused however because they have smoked wings and regular wings but they're not in the same place on the menu (one under entrees, the rest under wings section) but that's minor. The orange ginger had such a great flavor and just the right amount of spice. I've heard that some people have been underwhelmed by their food. \n\nAll in all, I'll definitely come back to try some more stuff.","name":"Huntsman Brewing","address":"124 Wonder St","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89502","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":44,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"WheelchairAccessible":"True","ByAppointmentOnly":"False","OutdoorSeating":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","Smoking":"u'no'","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': None, u'lot': None, u'validated': False}"},"categories":"Pizza, Chicken Wings, Food, Brewpubs, Nightlife, Beer Gardens, Pubs, Bars, Breweries, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"n3QRHqvOxqqgCqJLX9WC1A","business_id":"-qzHEErYuwly3XBGlVZy8g","stars_x":4.0,"date":1642040864000,"text":"Stopped by for beers and a snack this weekend, and I'll probably be back.

Until it's closure in early 2020, we visited Silver Peak on Wonder street 2-4 times a month and we haven't found an adequate replacement since. \n\nIt is important to note that at the time of this review, Washoe county is under a mandatory mask mandate for all indoor spaces. As we enter the familiar building we are greeted by a very friendly, but maskless host\/server named Alexa. Alexa proved to be the only bright spot during our visit. After being seated inside, we realized that the entire staff was maskless, and there was obviously no enforcement of a mask policy of any kind. We are both vaccinated and decided we could overcome the businesses lack of responsibility because we really, really wanted to like it there. We were excited to see that most of the old Silver Peak menu was still in place and we ordered our absolute favorite, the black bean nachos with chicken. We also order a couple of Huntsman beers, the IPA and the sour, both of which I would recommend. After placing our order I used the restroom and found it to be completely without hand soap. I informed Alexa and she assured me she would pass along the message to someone who could address it. When I returned to the table a couple of plates were set out for our nachos. Both of these plates had old food stuck on them. We were able to get these plates exchanged for clean ones without a problem. The restaurant was not necessarily busy but the nachos still took about 30 minutes to come out. When the nachos did arrive, we found them to be a smaller and somehow burnt version of the Silver Peak nachos we were accustomed to. At this point we had come across so many strikes against the place that we didn't even consider having a second beer.  Just before we left, I returned to the restroom to wash my hands and found that the hand soap had still not been refilled. I would have been content using hand sanitizer, but there was none of that to be found either. \n\nI am always understanding of the bumps that come along with a new business, like slow food service and recipes that aren't quite dialed in. In this case however, I can't look past the maskless employees, lack of a mask policy, and lack of either hand soap or hand sanitizer in a business that has just opened in the middle of a public health crisis. There's a certain common culture that can be found among midtown businesses that Huntsman completely lacks. I'd say there is no chance of us returning, which really sucks because we wanted Huntsman to be our new go to neighborhood restaurant.","name":"Huntsman Brewing","address":"124 Wonder St","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89502","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":44,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"WheelchairAccessible":"True","ByAppointmentOnly":"False","OutdoorSeating":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","Smoking":"u'no'","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': None, u'lot': None, u'validated': False}"},"categories":"Pizza, Chicken Wings, Food, Brewpubs, Nightlife, Beer Gardens, Pubs, Bars, Breweries, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"c6E8Z3iaD2pzwPRQ5cfWpA","business_id":"-qzHEErYuwly3XBGlVZy8g","stars_x":5.0,"date":1637819457000,"text":"Smoked wings and the fish and chips were GREAT.

A lot of fond memories were had here over the years, and I hope there are many more to come.\n\nMuch of what made this location good are still here, while also seriously revamping and updating things to boot. The building is unmistakable, sort of towering over the south end of Midtown with seating spread across multiple levels. There is the front bar room, which has been seriously upgraded and expanded, the adjoining main dining room, and also a private room upstairs which could be rented out for parties and is now decked out with a few pub games.  But most importantly, the roof deck is still here, maybe the best such roof deck in town, with great views of the mountains and downtown. All told, they have done quite the job remodeling the old property and giving it their own feel.\n\nThe beers and food have also gotten a serious revamp.  Beer-wise, their flagship Huntsman IPA is very solid and a good easy drinker, definitely what I would recommend the most. Their cream ale, the Teamwork Makes the Cream-Work, is also quite delightful and perfect on a warm, sunny afternoon. Their SOURon Pink Guava is very nice, and for sure worth a try.  They do brew a good Irish Stout, and the Old Ale was a very interesting find for any local beer nut to try. And surprisingly, in one of the holdovers from the old Silverpeak menu, they have not only revived the Red Roadster, but I think improved upon it. There are also plenty of guest taps on offer, as well as a full bar.\n\nThe menu still has a lot of familiar sorts of higher-end pub fare; pizzas, sandwiches, appetizers, salads, etc. But reading the selections, you notice several tweaks, such as the option on many items to add pork belly. I wound up getting an order of Fish n Chips along with their Gouda Mac n Cheese appetizer. (Always go with stuff with 'n' in the name.) The fish was perfectly fried and very tasty. Though I found the king-cut fries to be a bit under-fried and under-seasoned. The Mac n Cheese, however, was excellent. A good portion for one person, with melted gouda, and with the addition of pork belly mixed in, the deliciousness was ratcheted up another notch.\n\nPrices here for everything seemed very reasonable for the quality you get. Anywhere from under $10 for appetizers, to the $15-$20 range for a lot of entrees. Service was adequate, though a bit lacking in parts, with our party sort of being forgotten by the hostess for a good 15 minutes, and a few things like condiments and cutlery not being delivered until we had asked repeatedly. How much of this is due to staffing shortages, I am not sure, but hopefully that gets ironed out. Parking is relatively easy, with spaces in front and behind the building and lots of nearby street spaces, and of course is easy enough to walk over if you are already cruising around Midtown.\n\nAll in all, I am very happy to see a brewery back here again, and I think Huntsman is off to a good start. Looking forward to seeing how things shape up in the times ahead, and will look forward to coming back for another round.\n\nCheers, guys!","name":"Huntsman Brewing","address":"124 Wonder St","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89502","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":44,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"WheelchairAccessible":"True","ByAppointmentOnly":"False","OutdoorSeating":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","Smoking":"u'no'","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': None, u'lot': None, u'validated': False}"},"categories":"Pizza, Chicken Wings, Food, Brewpubs, Nightlife, Beer Gardens, Pubs, Bars, Breweries, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"YyrhuDInCT_yMAL0qHPfNQ","business_id":"-qzHEErYuwly3XBGlVZy8g","stars_x":1.0,"date":1635453585000,"text":"My wife and I, along with a couple of friends went to Huntsman a couple weeks into opening. We tried to order a couple items and they were already sold out for the night. \n\nLuckily, we managed to pick a few items that were still available as a group of four people. We were told to expect about a 30-45 minute delay on our food. \nTwo people in our party were given there meals about 45 minutes after ordering which were burgers and fries.  The burger was good, the fries were pretty limited in quantity and nothing too dynamic. The appetizer we ordered came about an hour after ordering and after two people had already finished their meals.  The final two meals came about two hours after ordering and only after a member of our group complained about it.  The last two items were a pulled pork sandwich and a pizza.  The pulled pork sandwich was fine but had very little pork on it.  The pizza was wonderful but that might have been due to how hungry the member of our group was by then.\n\nThe service was disappointing overall and while the server was doing all she could to speed things along she was getting very little support. The manager, I believe, was also sitting at a table drinking the entire time while our order was floundering and showed zero reaction until finally speeding things along when we complained. \n\nThe professionalism of sitting with people and drinking at 7:30\/8:00pm while the restaurant is brand new is pretty disappointing since staff should be working hard to impress customers after a new opening when delays may happen.\n\nSadly, after this experience, we won't be returning. There are so many other good options in town for a beer and bar food and the professionalism was lacking so much that I don't feel the need to go back.","name":"Huntsman Brewing","address":"124 Wonder St","city":"Reno","state":"NV","postal_code":"89502","stars_y":4.0,"review_count":44,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"WheelchairAccessible":"True","ByAppointmentOnly":"False","OutdoorSeating":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"False","Smoking":"u'no'","RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","HasTV":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"False","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","Alcohol":"u'full_bar'","BusinessParking":"{u'valet': False, u'garage': False, u'street': None, u'lot': None, u'validated': False}"},"categories":"Pizza, Chicken Wings, Food, Brewpubs, Nightlife, Beer Gardens, Pubs, Bars, Breweries, Restaurants"},{"review_id":"TPqOMNbrVWHzcQ1SysyGMQ","business_id":"-qzHEErYuwly3XBGlVZy8g","stars_x":3.0,"date":1632061933000,"text":"I like what they've done with the remodel, moving the bar to the window side was a great idea.

But finding a place that checks all the boxes without any referrals can feel like rolling the dice at the Nugget!\n\nHaving driven by the Nevada Taco Grill almost on a daily basis, got me thinking that some of the best under rated businesses are those \"hidden gems\". From the outside, there are very little in way of fancy graphics or marketing - this restaurant does share its space with the Vista Mart gas station. So basically, if you eat with your eyes, you will not consider Nevada Taco Grill but I for one - eat with my mouth so could care less about the looks. \n\nMy first give it a try experience was with my wife. As we were driving up Baring, I mentioned that I would like to try Nevada Taco Grill out. Since it was near lunch and we didn't have plans - it was game on!\n\nGoing through the drive through, the first thing you notice, as others have mentioned is the extensive menu. For a relatively small restaurant, they sure have plenty of options! My go to when dining Mexican food is carnitas burritos. My wife, chicken burritos. So we ordered one of each. \n\nThe food is definitely made to order as it took about 4 or 5 minutes from placing our order to receiving our food at the drive thru. This is not your typical fast food joint. It may speed things up if you call ahead but not too far ahead so your food is fresh.\n\nNow onto the food, that's why you are here right? Carnitas is roasted pork, so it shouldn't be mushy or too dry. My burritos was slightly on the wet side (most likely from the pico de gallo and guacamole) and there wasn't any charred meat until I got about half way. Not a deal breaker but with the charred meat you get some of that smoky flavor. There was no rice or beans which was surprising. You are getting your fill of protein here for sure!\n\nMy wife's chicken burrito was similar in that there wasn't any rice or bean filler but shredded grilled chicken breast, bell peppers and onions. That's it. Chicken breast can be dry if over done but this was on the money and was packed with quite a bit.\n\nFor a mild salsa try their green. If you prefer something with more punch the red will be worthy for your taste buds.\n\nWould we go again?

There were tables reserved for each team with the name of each team and number of team members printed on a laminated sign!\n\nNevertheless, the management had only one server and one bartender working, for more than 100 people! \n\nWe were there more than 30 minutes before anyone took our orders. The drink orders were all wrong, 2 of the food orders were wrong, and we couldn't talk to the server to get it fixed. I was drinking only water, and had to wait over an hour to get a second glass. My friend's drink was never done correctly. I went to the bartender to get it corrected (and get another glass of water) but was told that I had to \"wait for your server\".\n\nThe staff were overwhelmed (including kitchen staff) and seemed to have been completely unprepared (with a month's notice!). The server was doing her best, but there is no excuse that the management put her in that position. If they can't get the staff for the event, then the management\/owners needed to be there to help out!\n\nFor what it's worth the food was pretty good. We had seven people and everyone said good things about their food.

Simply put - Cafe Whitney is a must-try spot in Reno!\n\nWe recently treated ourselves to a much-needed staycation at Whitney Peak Hotel (hot tip: skip the casinos and STAY HERE!) Part of the appeal was Cafe Whitney downstairs, which we have heard great things about. We were lucky enough to snag same-day reservations for dinner - woo hoo!\n\nUpon entering from the hotel side, we found the decor to be fun and fancy - beaded curtains, high ceilings, open kitchen... it was simultaneously rustic and modern and we loved it!\n\nWe both started with the Pom-Grenade, an amped up cocktail that definitely started off the meal with a bang. It was delicious! We also tried a cup of their soup de jour, a loaded baked potato soup that was SO yummy! Definitely a step above your classic potato+bacon+cheese+sour cream mashup. The housemade croutons on top put it over the edge!\n\nFor dinner, we went with their Diner Burger with fries and a fish special that came with orzo. The fish was good, nothing special - but the orzo was SO GOOD! Lemony and bright, every little bite was like a pillow that was just the right amount of toothsome. This dish totally changed orzo for me, it's like my new favorite thing now! The Burger was solid - delicious, big, and juicy. The shoestring fries were also a tasty addition!\n\nSomehow, unbelievably, we saved room for dessert! The Raspberry Zinfandel Sorbet was a fruity refreshing end to a charmed meal.\n\nI love the unpretentious vibe of this place, even though the food is definitely fine-dining quality!

The exterior windows have some form of bars\/protection on both the inside and out. The menu selections were displayed on menu boards both on the wall to the left of the counter with pictures and as a list on the wall behind the order counter. We were amazed they had 7 different sizes of pizzas and had never seen anything like that before. \n\nMy wife ordered a small Hawaiian pizza and I ordered a small meat lovers pizza along with a soda and water. We did notice they had a few bottled beers (Modelo, Corona and Blue Moon) as well as Budweiser on tap. \n\nMy wife went up to the soda machine and the woman who had taken our order let us know that she had to turn the machine on in order for it to dispense. We thought that was strange and we wondered if that is to prevent stealing? \n\nThere was only one other customer seated but there were several people who came in to pick up take out orders. \n\nWhile we were waiting for our pizzas, a man came in with a bag and went up to the counter and pulled out pieces of clothing and asked the employee and my wife if they liked brand new stuff and proceeded to try and get either of them to show interest. They both declined and he left. \n\nOur pizzas arrived a short time later and looked pretty good. They tasted pretty good too. Mind blowing good....no.  Decent.....yes. \n\nThe prices seem comparable with other pizza places in town but the atmosphere and ability to relax and enjoy a meal as a couple or family is definitely lacking. There are many other options in town that provide that so we likely won't be back.

It is not a \"destination\" restaurant. The first time there, I ordered a steak salad. The salad was fine and the greens were fresh, but the steak was very gristly and inedible. Not a good start. The second time was much better - my husband and I shared the Karrage Chicken, bites of  japanese-style fried chicken with a dipping sauce. They were good - the sauce really makes this special. I also had a cup of the tomato bisque that is also very good. Our third visit was for hamburgers. They were very generous portions and cooked to order, but were nothing special.

When I mentioned it to the young lady she said, \"well we had to bake them earlier so that's why they are burned\". I'm not sure why the time of day effects the state of the cookie, but okay. She was very sweet, but definitely did not offer to redo the order. \nAdditionally, each cookie was supposed to be individually wrapped per the website. These cookies were not wrapped, so I asked about it. The woman said \"I didn't know you wanted that\". When I said that the website provided that detail she said \"yeah don't ever use the website, it can be wrong a lot\".... this really did not make me feel better about my order. By the way, I didn't order online, I called the store. \nIn the end, they gave me 50% off, but I feel I need to share because the excuses were ridiculous, and there wasn't an offer to remake the order.

The shopping experience is usually OK. Their produce selection is usually pretty nice and fairly priced. I love the selection in their bakery department with their muffins, chocolate dipped cookies, and cakes being my favorites. Their deli is nice, but the selection rarely changes so if you shop there frequently it does get boring. They do make a delicious roast beef sandwich with a horseradish sauce called Kickin' Roast Beef though. There is a small problem with items being stocked on the shelves at times. I also feel some items in this store are overpriced especially toiletry\/beauty items. The store has recently gone through some upgrades. They added a soup bar, a place to sit and eat deli purchases, and instead of the traditional meat and seafood department they offer a grill where you can get grilled chicken, ribs, tri-tip, steaks, etc. This area also has daily specials. The hamburgers are good, but the tri-tip tacos and sandwiches are my favorites. They have a nice liquor department with a huge selection of wine. The pet supplies aisle is small, but in a pinch I can always find dog or cat food and other supplies for my pets. The cashiers are nice even though I will say some can be pretty unprofessional. Only ever had one issue that made me want to stop shopping here. I was sick and stopped in for medicine, Gatorade, soup, etc. The young man bagging my groceries was talking to the customer in front of me and put my bags in his cart. I did not realize this until I asked for my things. He ran after the prior customer to retrieve my things twice as he did not get them all the first time. He seemed to find it funny. I not feeling well did not see the humor in the situation. The store manager cared enough to call me when I complained so I let it drop there.\nThe number one reason for my low rating is the pharmacy. I recently gave them another try after many frustrating experiences with them in years past. Nothing has changed. The staff is rude and apathetic. Their lack of communication is my main complaint. Prescriptions are not ready when expected with no communication from them. They blame the doctor. As of this review I am still waiting on a medication I originally requested weeks ago. I found out they faxed the refill request to the wrong doctor, but even after the correction I still don't have the medication. At 7pm on a Friday night, I went to pick up my insulin (Type 1 diabetic) refill that was requested a week in advance. I spoke to my doctor's office that assured me they had sent them a new prescription. It was not ready, and they said the doctor had sent them nothing. I normally have no issues with my doctor approving my medication refills. I was out of insulin. They suggested urgent care of which most locations are closed at 7pm. Again, no communication from the pharmacy. My prior pharmacy (which no longer takes my insurance) helped me out by selling me enough from an existing prescription they still had on file to get me by until I could reach my doctor. At $126 for one insulin pen versus $25 per box of five pens it was not a pleasant experience. I will be switching pharmacies for sure.","name":"Save Mart","address":"9750 Pyramid Lakes Hwy","city":"Sparks","state":"NV","postal_code":"89436","stars_y":3.5,"review_count":32,"is_open":1,"attributes":{"RestaurantsPriceRange2":"2","RestaurantsAttire":"u'casual'","GoodForKids":"True","OutdoorSeating":"False","WiFi":"'free'","HasTV":"False","RestaurantsReservations":"False","Alcohol":"'full_bar'","RestaurantsGoodForGroups":"True","NoiseLevel":"u'quiet'","Caters":"True","BusinessParking":"{'garage': False, 'street': False, 'validated': False, 'lot': True, 'valet': False}","BikeParking":"True","RestaurantsTakeOut":"True","BusinessAcceptsCreditCards":"True","RestaurantsDelivery":"True"},"categories":"Food, Restaurants, Bakeries, Grocery, Delis, Sandwiches, Meat Shops, Specialty Food"},{"review_id":"L9M_j8b46XzQoYECtRLSLg","business_id":"2Ec7JLAHcJo4Aj2yvqfkiA","stars_x":4.0,"date":1559423250000,"text":"So after taking a restroom stop, I noticed the nice coffee bar. \n\nWhat a nice treat!

Stop, no and don't! \nI saw pictures of the food here posted online with the caption of \"the best breakfast in reno!\" So naturally my husband and I decided to try it out. I made reservations online for the following morning. This restaurant is located inside the whitney peak hotel. The ambience of the restaurant is gorgeous, hence the two stars. You almost forget there are meth addicts sitting right outside!\nWhen we arrived, there were only 3 other tables in the entire restaurant, and I joked with the lady who was seating us, I am so glad I made a reservation! \n\nOur server came and brought drinks and took our order. They have a very limited menu here for breakfast but we don't typically mind, since it makes it easier to decide. I settled on a breakfast sandwich on brioche bun, my husband ordered a basic egg breakfast. Both of our plates were served with potatoes. \n\nOkay so the food... was not good. The breakfast potatoes were some of the worst potatoes I've ever had (aside from gray potatoes in oregon but that's another story). They were clearly old and had been sitting and I am pretty sure I saw them get those potatoes from the breakfast buffet for the hotel customers. You are literally paying for buffet food that's been sitting out for hours. \nI couldn't eat my sandwich with the bun, there was entirely too much bread to egg ratio and they covered my sandwich in American cheese... it was more like a grilled cheese sandwich than a breakfast one at this point. So gross. My husband didn't enjoy his meal either since everything tasted old. \n\nThe worst part about shitty food is when the server disappears and leaves you sitting for 40 minutes. We almost walked out on our bill (which we shouldn't have even paid for because the food was trash). Finally after being frustrated we went to the bar, demanded our check and left. There was only 2 other tables in this place! Where did our server go? Do they serve the food then hide because they know it's awful?

Dirty tables  ect. I felt so bad for our little server named autumn   Who was amazing i must add.  I then asked her if she has a manager or supervisor on duty and low and behold she finally emerged from her cave!!!  I asked her to come here. I went on to tell her she was failing her team. Not one table was clean. No support system at all. Customers waiting to get a clean table. Servers still just trying to give great customer service.  But cant do it all.   I told her she needs to b a team player and set her crew up for success. Her first response was sorry i was on phone.  10 more minutes after speaking to night manager she still didnt lift a hand to bus a table or seat the customers. She flat threw her team to the wolves. More less sink or swim.  And didnt seem to care at all. The food was incredible. The salad bar was stocked and delicious  everything was amazing besides that manager on duty that didnt seem to help her team at all.

We had never been to Iron Skillet before and without an alternate plan of attack we decided to give it a try. \nAt first glance, I was impressed with the cleanliness and bright, homey appearance of the dining room. It's a seat-yourself truck stop diner but they had a lot of sections closed so the seat selection was sparse. Once we were seated i tried to take of my scarf but soon realized that the restaurant was FREEZING! So I had to sit there bundled up while we ate (annoyance, but no biggie).\nOur waitress, Susan, seemed friendly enough when taking our order. I had ordered the captain's seafood platter (deep fried fish, clam strips and shrimp) and asked for Cole slaw as I figured a whole plate full of fried seafood was enough grease for one meal. Susan kindly informed me that coleslaw was on the included salad bar (which has REAL bacon for bacon bits) and encouraged me to try something else, so I ordered mashed potatoes with brown gravy. He ordered the double bacon cheeseburger and fries. \nOur food arrived promptly and hot (here's where they start losing stars) but accompanied by our check. Although the check had a cute smiley face and a thank you, it was still a little rude in my book. About halfway through our meal our drinks started running low and I tried to catch our waitress' eye and she saw me, smiled, and promptly ignored me. I wasn't about to shout across the restaurant for more Dr Pepper. \nNow the food...I was a little concerned that my meal was overcooked at how dark the breading was but it turned out to be nice and crispy on the outside and hot and tender on the inside. I was most impressed by the shrimp as they were large and flavorful. I don't typically order fried food but the clam strips sounded so appealing! I was surprised the mashed potatoes were house made and although chunky and laced with bits of potato skin they were delicious and the gravy was not overly salty.  I had a bite of his burger and after imagining a tasty Texas toast burger from Ernie's I was disappointed in that the meat was lacking flavor and it was just an ordinary run of the mill greasy burger.

So, when I discovered that it added another location in South Reno, my wife and I were stoked. My youngest daughter had never heard of the place since she moved with us to Reno when she was 1 year old. \nYesterday, we decided that it was time to introduce our daughter to a Mofo's pizza. The whole family is happy we did.\nWhen I first viewed the menu my first thought was Incline prices for a Reno market might not fly. This idea let my mind as soon as we got home and opened the box. We ordered their combination and it was layered on in very generous portions. Each slice felt like a full meal. No skimping on the ingredients. While I like a crustier dough, I have no complaints when presented with fresh tasting toppings like they give you in the combo. \nWhat also truck me as being a major positive was that it didn't taste like a salt block. A number of the big chain pizza places have way too much salt for my liking. It felt like just the right amount to extract the maximum amount of flavor from each of the ingredients.\nWill I go back? Of course, in a heart beat. My next visit though may have to bypass the pizza and try some of their sandwiches (meatball is my favorite). Welcome to Reno Mofo's!!!

The Mongolian beef had a little too much ginger and salt in it for my taste, which was a sharp contrast to the green pepper beef I tried last time. I think I'll stick to that one in the future. On the positive side, the rice today was delicious -- not dry at all. The chow mein was probably my favorite part of the meal, and I do enjoy the very simple egg rolls here. They have hot mustard, which I love, and the service was beyond what I ever expect for lunch.

One was sleeping, the other was playing on the iPad on each dining table. My family wanted to dine in and ordered drinks thinking we were dining in, but they brought our food to go so I'm guessing dine in wasn't allowed but they did not let us know. With the covid restrictions and limitations to the capacity of restaurant. I just feel that the kids should be seated on one table as there were no room for customers to order and wait. There were 10 people total in the dining area so everyone had to stand around and wait, and no one was 6 ft apart. I might be back if I'm in the mood for Chinese food.

I perused their menu and finally decided on a mini pepperoni and mushroom pizza and an order of hot chicken wings. I called to place the order and was told it would be ready in 10-15 minutes. I was quickly greeted upon my arrival. My food needed a couple more minutes so I chatted with the hostess while I waited. She said they had just opened the day before and that they were hoping to be able to offer delivery in another month or so.\n\nMy food came out and I left. Pizza is one of those things that is best when it's hot so I dug in while I was driving home. Oh my goodness! The pizza was absolutely delicious! The toppings were fresh and the sauce was tasty. It was loaded with LOTS of melty cheese. After I got home I opened the chicken wings. Plenty of ranch dressing and the wings had a nice buffalo flavor. I was not disappointed.

The decor is very Tahoe, decorated with warm wood accents. The signature marinara and meatballs is a savory dish that doesn't disappoint. The wings are generous and tasty too. The BBQ chicken pizza with jalape\u00c3\u00b1os added is delicious! This will definitely be a go to hot spot for us!\nThe service is friendly and the prices are reasonable.

I am a HUGE pizza guy and knew I needed to check it out after reading the reviews.\n\nWe arrived and were immediately greeted by a young lady and provided menus.  Since we arrived between the typical lunch and dinner we weren't surprised to see we were the only people in the restaurant.  \n\nWe looked over the menu and my wife decided on the house salad with blue cheese dressing and three of the Mofo Meatballs.  I chose the small meat lovers pizza  with extra sauce since I find most places do not put enough sauce for my liking.\n\nMy wife's food arrived first and looked yummy - she enjoyed it but she mentioned that she felt bad that I was watching her eat and she wished she would have requested that her salad and meatballs come out at the same time as the pizza.  \n\nMy pizza arrived a short time later and also looked delicious!  It is New York style with the thin foldable crust and thick outer edge. I really liked the dough and felt the amount of sauce was perfect.  \n\nWhile we were there a steady stream of to-go orders came in via phone or in person and several tables sat down as well.

My daughter was obsessed with watching the guys making the pizzas, they were flipping and spinning each pizza, it was awesome! You don't see that anymore! We ordered mozzarella sticks as an appetizer, and a half cheese half pepperoni pizza. The mozzarella sticks were fresh and flavorful!  The pizza marinara sauce with the mozzarella sticks was wonderful!  The pizza was fantastic! The crust was thin under the sauce and cheese, but think around the edge! A perfect combo!  The pepperoni was a little spicer (not a bad thing) then \"typical\" which was wonderful to balance out the sweetness of the sweet sauce!  There were quite a few customers in the restaurant, but the staff was still very attentive and fast. \n\nWe are already planning on coming back to try more things on the menu!!
